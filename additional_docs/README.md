# Additional AAP documentation

Some other relevant AAP documents are placed, or being automatically generated here.

NOTE: Only text (`.txt`) files, under this folder, are being actually supported, other files will be not processed neither ingested into the vector store.

## Ansible Components' versions

The file `components_versions.txt` is being automatically generated, and it contains information about latest releases for some AAP components.

NOTE: Do NOT modify `components_versions.txt`, content will be automatically generated.

## Additional content (manual)

The file `additional_content.txt` contains information that it is not actually part of the AAP docs, and needs to be ingested as well.

The file `additional_content.txt` is being MANUALLY updated with additional content, either by docs, management or engineering teams.

NOTE: The information on this file should not change often, otherwise manual updates during releases will consume much time. 
Please consider automating the content generation in case information changes often.
