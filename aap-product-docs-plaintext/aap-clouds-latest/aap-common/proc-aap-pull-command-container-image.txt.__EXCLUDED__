For example, if your foundation deployment version is 2.4.20240215-00, you must pull the operational image with tag 2.4.20240215.

Use the following commands:

$ export IMAGE=registry.redhat.io/ansible-on-clouds/ansible-on-clouds-ops-rhel9:2.4.20240215
$ docker pull $IMAGE --platform=linux/amd64


[NOTE]
----
If your foundation deployment version is not 2.4.20240215-00, refer to the tables on the Released versions page for a matching deployment version, in the column Ansible on Clouds version, and find the corresponding operational image to use, in the column Ansible-on-clouds-ops container image, for the IMAGE environment variable.
