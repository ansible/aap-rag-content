# Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS PULL and PUSH models

# Automation using the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS control plane

The Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS offers a deployment of Ansible Automation Platform deployment purchased through AWS Marketplace. Red&#160;Hat configures and provisions an Ansible Automation Platform. The Red&#160;Hat team handles the setup and maintenance of the Ansible Automation Platform, ensuring reliability and security.

While Red&#160;Hat manages the control plane, the execution plane is spread across your domains using automation mesh hop nodes and execution nodes.
For help with configuring execution nodes see
Automation mesh for managed cloud or operator environments.

There are two ways to configure the communication between control nodes and execution nodes:

* The PULL connectivity model (recommended)
* The PUSH connectivity model

# PULL connectivity

Remote automation mesh nodes can access Ansible Automation Platform using a 'polling' or 'pull' model, which does not require opening ingress ports in the firewall.
This model eliminates the need for hop nodes from your demilitarized zone (DMZ) to private networks if private networks have outbound internet connectivity.



# PUSH connectivity

You can design their automation mesh architecture using the push model and configure the communication ports.
The default port is 27199, which must not conflict with other traffic, such as HTTPS.
Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS supports current automation mesh features that push communication to both hop nodes and execution nodes.
