# Network

When you deploy Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure, you can configure the following networks in the Networking tab of the form:

* The networking address range (CIDR block) for the VNet that your Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure application uses.
* AKS network CIDR blocks.


[NOTE]
----
Plan your networking configuration before you deploy the Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure application, because you cannot change it after deployment.
