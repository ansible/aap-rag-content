# Connectivity

The execution plane can communicate with the control plane under the following conditions:

* Polling (mesh-ingress): Execution nodes must route stateful egress traffic to the Ansible Automation Platform deployment domain over port 443.
* Push: A configurable firewall port must be open in the customerâ€™s remote networks to allow Ansible Automation Platform to push information to execution nodes.

You can configure automation mesh nodes behind firewalls, proxy servers, and similar services.
These services route or proxy traffic originating from Ansible Automation Platform without altering headers, payload, or other information that would affect functionality of the automation mesh.
