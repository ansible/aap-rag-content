# Control plane

The Ansible Automation Platform control plane includes the application UIs, APIs, components, and services used for managing automation.
Red Hat manages these within its own infrastructure.

# Customer access

Your access to the control plane is specific to the Ansible Automation Platform user interfaces and APIs.

During the initial configuration of an Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS deployment, you receive the URL for your deployment.
You can also find this information through the Red&#160;Hat Hybrid Cloud Console (HCC).

The administrator account&#8217;s initial password is provided to the HCC user who performed the initial deployment.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Change this password immediately after your first login to Ansible Automation Platform.
----

If you need help accessing your deployment, submit a support request through the Red Hat Customer Portal.

# Service uptime

Uptime for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS is measured by user access and function of the Ansible Automation Platform control plane.
This is measured through the uptime of the product web user interface and REST APIs.
Measurements are calculated through successful HTTP response codes (200) to entry points of the UI and API.
If either of these return an unsuccessful response code, or are unavailable and time out entirely, then the service will be considered to be in an outage state.
Uptime of the execution plane, which is managed by customers, is not included as part of the uptime of the service.
Customers are responsible for ensuring that the execution plane is redundant, scalable, and available in order to meet customer uptime objectives.

# SRE access and management

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) access is limited to the infrastructure and services running Ansible Automation Platform.
Red Hat only accesses the Ansible Automation Platform interfaces or APIs in exceptional cases, such as during support engagements.

SRE access to control plane resources is restricted to operations that require human intervention and cannot be automated.
Any access follows a request-and-approval process and is audited to ensure only authorized personnel can perform these operations.

SREs access resources and audit data are collected when:

* The SRE team requests access to cluster resources using a tool that allows temporary access. This tool generates a log entry detailing the time and the SRE team member who requested access.
* Audit logs are created for any management operation performed on a customer instance and are sent to a centralized logging system.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Red Hat erases job logs every 30 days.

# Backup and disaster recovery

Red&#160;Hat maintains daily database and file system snapshots in a separate region from each deployment.



This recovery data is used if an AWS regional outage cannot be resolved in a reasonable time.

Customer data is replicated to a predefined secondary region based on the deployment region. The currently paired regions are:



To recover an Ansible Automation Platform deployment in a different AWS region, a customer must submit a request specifying their preferred deployment region from the available options.
Red&#160;Hat evaluates the request and begins building an instance in that region.
Data from the previous instance is recovered from the customerâ€™s business continuity region.
The customer is responsible for any necessary post-deployment network configuration to integrate the new instance into their environment.


[NOTE]
----
Backup data is not directly accessible to customers.
The data is only used in the event of infrastructure failure, not customer configuration errors.
Red Hat encourages using configuration-as-code practices to maintain a customer-hosted backup of your configuration.

# Infrastructure monitoring

Red&#160;Hat is responsible for monitoring the control plane.
You do not have access to add any additional monitoring to the resources that run the control plane.

# Application monitoring and customer audits

The Ansible Automation Platform activity stream provides detailed information about access to Ansible Automation Platform and usage.
To retain this information for auditing or compliance, you must export the logs to supported logging services for retention and querying.

# Status notification

Red&#160;Hat communicates the health and status of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS clusters through the Red&#160;Hat Hybrid Cloud Console, email notifications to the original deployment contact, and any additional contacts you specify.

# Security

## Identity and access management

Ansible Automation Platform includes a built-in user model for configuring users and RBAC permissions that define access.
Red&#160;Hat recommends using an enterprise identity provider with Ansible Automation Platform to implement multi-factor authentication for users.
See the
Access management and authentication
guide for more information.


[NOTE]
----
Red Hat advises keeping at least one local administrator account with a long, complex password for emergency access.
----

## Encryption

Data is encrypted at rest in both the database and file system using Red&#160;Hat managed encryption keys.
Data in transit is encrypted with TLS 1.2 or higher.

# Hosted components

The objective of this offering is to provide an Ansible Automation Platform deployment as a managed service,
relieving customers of managing the Ansible Automation Platform control plane.
Unless specified otherwise, all Ansible Automation Platform capabilities in the operator-based deployment model are supported.
