# Peering a VWAN Hub to the Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure Network

Before peering, you must connect a hub network, and at least one spoke network, to the hub network of the Azure VWAN to which you intend to connect Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure.

* A pre-configured Azure VWAN.
* One or more of the following connections to the VWAN:
* A DMZ network that contains Azure virtual machines that users can remotely log into to access Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure.
* A DMZ network that contains an Azure virtual machine that local machines can connect to with SSH tunneling to access Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure.
* A VPN or Direct Connect service to your local network that routes traffic from local machines to Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure.

1. Navigate to the Virtual Network Connections page for the VWAN that you want to peer with your Ansible Automation Platform instance.
2. To create a connection between the VWAN hub and your Ansible Automation Platform instance, use the following settings:
* Connection Name: <Ansible_Automation_Platform_connection_name>
* Hubs: Select one or more VWAN hub networks that the managed application VNet peers with.
* Subscription: Select the subscription where Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure has been deployed.
* Resource group: The managed resource group of the managed application. It is typically prefixed with “mrg-”.
* Virtual network: The VNet of the managed application. There is only one VNet in the managed resource group.
* Propagate to none: No
* Associate Route Table: Select the default route table or the appropriate route table that your organization has configured for VWAN.
* Propagate to Route Tables: Select one or more default route tables or the appropriate route table that your organization has configured for VWAN.
* Propagate to labels: Select labels if your organization uses them.
* Static routes: Do not complete this field.

When network peering completes, traffic routes to and from Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure though your VWAN hub network.

* Connect a virtual network to a Virtual WAN hub - portal (Microsoft Azure Virtual WAN documentation)
