# Canceling Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure deployments

You can gracefully cancel a Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure deployment.

1. Login to the deployment engine to display the progress of the deployment steps in the Ansible Automation Platform Deployment Engine page.
Refer to
Monitoring deployments on the Ansible Automation Platform Deployment Engine
for information on accessing and logging into the Ansible Automation Platform Deployment Engine page.
2. To cancel the deployment, click btn:[Cancel Deployment] and confirm.

This action cancels all the remaining steps in the deployment, including the currently running step. It also cancels pending steps in the deployment.

The status for the steps that have not been executed updates to Canceled.
To view the deployment processes on Azure, navigate to the Overview page for the managed resource group in which you deployed Ansible Automation Platform and select Deployments.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Canceling the deployment does not delete the managed application from your Azure subscription.
To avoid incurring costs for the managed application and other resources that are still running, you must delete them.

3. To delete Azure resources, navigate to the resource group for your deployment in the Azure portal. Select the resources you want to delete and click btn:[Delete].
For more information about deleting resources, refer to Manage Azure resources by using the Azure portal in the Microsoft Azure documentation.
