# SRE access and management

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) access is limited to the infrastructure and services running Ansible Automation Platform.
Red Hat only accesses the Ansible Automation Platform interfaces or APIs in exceptional cases, such as during support engagements.

SRE access to control plane resources is restricted to operations that require human intervention and cannot be automated.
Any access follows a request-and-approval process and is audited to ensure only authorized personnel can perform these operations.

SREs access resources and audit data are collected when:

* The SRE team requests access to cluster resources using a tool that allows temporary access. This tool generates a log entry detailing the time and the SRE team member who requested access.
* Audit logs are created for any management operation performed on a customer instance and are sent to a centralized logging system.

Red Hat erases job logs every 30 days.
