# Access details

Regardless of whether Ansible Automation Platform was deployed with public or private access,
a set of DNS records is created.
The DNS records are created so that Ansible Automation Platform can be issued a valid TLS certificate for your deployment and to enable easy access to your applications.

To view a list of the URLs for the Ansible Automation Platform applications, navigate to the Parameters and Outputs page of the Azure Marketplace managed application listing for your deployment.

For more details about the Parameters and Outputs page, see
