# Identity and access management

Ansible Automation Platform includes a built-in user model for configuring users and RBAC permissions that define access.
Red&#160;Hat recommends using an enterprise identity provider with Ansible Automation Platform to implement multi-factor authentication for users.
See the
Access management and authentication
guide for more information.


[NOTE]
----
Red Hat advises keeping at least one local administrator account with a long, complex password for emergency access.
