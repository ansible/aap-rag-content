# Deployment-self-service

You can self-service deployments including, but not limited to, the following operations:

* Buy and deploy an Ansible Automation Platform on AWS environment.
* Cancel an Ansible Automation Platform on AWS environment subscription.

When you cancel or do not renew a subscription in the AWS Marketplace, the service begins the deprovisioning process 72 hours after the cancellation.
All assets related to the deployment will be destroyed and will be unrecoverable.
If you initiate a cancellation, your deployment will shut down within a few hours.
If you initiated the cancellation in error you have 48 hours from the initial cancellation to submit a Support ticket and the Red Hat team will assist you in recovering the cancelled deployment.
