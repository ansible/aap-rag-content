# Automation mesh

Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS provides default “mesh-ingress” hop nodes.
These hosted hop nodes allow execution nodes to poll for automation work through egress from a customer’s private network, eliminating the need to open inbound firewall ports.
Hosted hop nodes use port 443 for inbound traffic.

The following is an example of an execution node in a private address space with egress-only internet access connected to Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS through this model.



You can also configure the automation mesh with outbound connectivity from the control plane to your execution plane, allowing you to specify the ports used by the automation mesh.

You can use the Automation mesh for managed cloud or operator environments documentation for instructions.
