# Account management

This section provides an overview of the billing and environment management operations.

# Billing

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS is billed through Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Pricing is based on the number of managed active nodes and related infrastructure management costs.
Discount tiers are available for pre-purchasing managed active nodes at the start of a billing cycle.

The service includes one Ansible Automation Platform deployment and 10 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) entitlements for running your automation execution plane.

# Deployment-self-service

You can self-service deployments including, but not limited to, the following operations:

* Buy and deploy an Ansible Automation Platform on AWS environment.
* Cancel an Ansible Automation Platform on AWS environment subscription.

When you cancel or do not renew a subscription in the AWS Marketplace, the service begins the deprovisioning process 72 hours after the cancellation.
All assets related to the deployment will be destroyed and will be unrecoverable.
If you initiate a cancellation, your deployment will shut down within a few hours.
If you initiated the cancellation in error you have 48 hours from the initial cancellation to submit a Support ticket and the Red Hat team will assist you in recovering the cancelled deployment.

# Regions and availability zones

Each supported region is paired with a companion AWS region where backup data is stored in the event of a primary region catastrophe that requires restoration in another AWS region.
Refer to Backup and diaster recovery for the list of supported and back up regions.

# Service level agreement

Any service level agreements (SLAs) for the service itself are defined in Appendix 4 (Online Subscription Services) of the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement Product Appendices.

## Limited support status

When a deployment transitions to "Limited Support" status, Red Hat will no longer troubleshoot execution plane issues.
The SLA is no longer applicable and credits requested against the SLA are denied.
However, this does not mean you lose all product support. A deployment can return to full support if you address the issues that caused the limited status.

A deployment might move to a Limited Support status for several reasons, including:

Lack of an execution plane:: A customer execution plane is required for automation.
If you have not configured one or if it's in a degraded state, you must fix these issues before receiving automation support.
Unsupported Execution Plane Dependencies:: Both Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and OpenShift-based execution planes need regular maintenance and upgrades to meet minimum supported versions for Ansible Automation Platform dependencies.
You can upgrade these resources using various methods, such as Ansible for patching, Red Hat Satellite, or DNF automatic updates.
Keeping your OS, cluster, and receptor resources updated with supported Ansible Automation Platform helps reduce support issues.
