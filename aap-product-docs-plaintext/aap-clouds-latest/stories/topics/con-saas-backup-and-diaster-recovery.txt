# Backup and disaster recovery

Red&#160;Hat maintains daily database and file system snapshots in a separate region from each deployment.



This recovery data is used if an AWS regional outage cannot be resolved in a reasonable time.

Customer data is replicated to a predefined secondary region based on the deployment region. The currently paired regions are:



To recover an Ansible Automation Platform deployment in a different AWS region, a customer must submit a request specifying their preferred deployment region from the available options.
Red&#160;Hat evaluates the request and begins building an instance in that region.
Data from the previous instance is recovered from the customerâ€™s business continuity region.
The customer is responsible for any necessary post-deployment network configuration to integrate the new instance into their environment.


[NOTE]
----
Backup data is not directly accessible to customers.
The data is only used in the event of infrastructure failure, not customer configuration errors.
Red Hat encourages using configuration-as-code practices to maintain a customer-hosted backup of your configuration.
