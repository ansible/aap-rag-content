# PULL connectivity

Remote automation mesh nodes can access Ansible Automation Platform using a 'polling' or 'pull' model, which does not require opening ingress ports in the firewall.
This model eliminates the need for hop nodes from your demilitarized zone (DMZ) to private networks if private networks have outbound internet connectivity.
