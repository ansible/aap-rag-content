# Configuring network peering with the Ansible Automation Platform subnet

Within the Azure console, the Azure virtual network (VNet) is known as this virtual network, and the VNet that you want to peer with is known as remote virtual network.

In the Virtual Networks page in the Azure portal, use the following settings to configure peering between the Azure VNet and the VNet that you want to peer with the Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure app:

* Under This virtual network, select settings for the Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure virtual network:
* Peering link name: <hub_to_aap_peering_link_name>
* Traffic to remote virtual network: Allow
* Traffic forwarded from remove virtual network: Allow
* Virtual network gateway or Route Server: Use this network’s gateway or Route server
* Under Remote virtual network, select settings for the virtual network that you want to peer with Azure:
* Peering link name: <aap_to_hub_peering_link_name>
* Traffic to remote virtual network: Allow
* Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network: Allow
* Virtual network gateway or Route Server: Use the remote virtual network’s gateway or Route server
