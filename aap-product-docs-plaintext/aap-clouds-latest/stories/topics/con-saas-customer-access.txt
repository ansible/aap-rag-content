# Customer access

Your access to the control plane is specific to the Ansible Automation Platform user interfaces and APIs.

During the initial configuration of an Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS deployment, you receive the URL for your deployment.
You can also find this information through the Red&#160;Hat Hybrid Cloud Console (HCC).

The administrator account&#8217;s initial password is provided to the HCC user who performed the initial deployment.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Change this password immediately after your first login to Ansible Automation Platform.

If you need help accessing your deployment, submit a support request through the Red Hat Customer Portal.
