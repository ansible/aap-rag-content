# Updating the route tables

Before you update the route tables, confirm that you satisfy the Prerequisites for the hub-and-spoke peering process.
1. Navigate to Route Tables in the Azure portal.
2. As part of your hub-and-spoke configuration, you created one or more route tables to define the routes between the networks. Click on one of these route tables.
3. From the route table menu bar, click Routes > Add.
4. Configure routes from your existing networks to send traffic to Ansible Automation Platform. You must configure routes for any network requesting Ansible Automation Platform user interfaces and for any network that will have automation performed against its resources.
For each route that you add, enter the following information:
* Route name: Enter a route name for the Ansible Automation Platform managed application network
* Address Prefix: The CIDR block of the managed application kubernetes cluster
* Next Hop Type: Virtual network gateway
5. Click OK to save the new route to the route list.
Repeat this procedure for all other route tables where you want to route traffic to Ansible Automation Platform.
Add a route for each spoke network that you would like Ansible Automation Platform to communicate with, for automation or for accessing the user interfaces.
1. Navigate to Route Tables in the Azure portal.
2. In the list of route tables, select the route table for the Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure managed application.

The name of the Ansible Automation Platform route table uses the following convention:

```
aks-agentpool-<numbers>-routetable
```

3. From the route table menu bar, click Routes > Add.
4. Configure routing to your VNets for each spoke network that you would like Ansible Automation Platform to communicate with, for both automation or accessing the user interfaces.
5. For each route that you add, enter the following information:
* Route name: Enter a route name for the spoke network that you want Ansible Automation Platform to route to
* Address Prefix: The CIDR block of the spoke network
* Next Hop Type: Virtual network gateway
6. Click OK to save the new route to the route list.
After you have configured the routing rules, traffic is routed to and from Ansible Automation Platform on Azure through your hub network.
If your organization uses Azure firewall services or third-party firewall appliances through a Virtual Appliance connection, you must configure outbound connectivity from the managed application, to enable Red Hat to maintain your application and to enable automation against external resources.
The easiest way to implement this is to create a firewall rule that allows all outbound traffic from port 443.
If you choose not to allow all outbound traffic from  port 443, you must configure routes.
* For Red Hat to manage and upgrade Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure and execute security patching, any machine in the Azure Kubernetes service (AKS) cluster must be allowed to submit a request to pull updates for containers used by Ansible Automation Platform.

Add routes in the Ansible Automation Platform route table for outbound traffic from the full CIDR range of the Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure managed application to the domains listed in the Azure Virtual Appliance Routing with Ansible Automation Platform on Azure article on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
* You must also allow traffic from your firewall to any other external domain or IP address that you want Ansible Automation Platform to run automation jobs against.
Otherwise, your firewall blocks connectivity between Ansible Automation Platform and destinations for automation.
* Ansible Automation Platform requires a public DNS zone to provide SSL certificates.
This public DNS zone is in the managed resource group of the deployment.
The platform must be able to communicate via DNS queries with the servers listed in the DNS zone to complete certificate challenges with our upstream provider.
Blocking this communication prevents successful certificate renewal.
