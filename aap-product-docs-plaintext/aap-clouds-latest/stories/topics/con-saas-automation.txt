# Automation using the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS control plane

The Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS offers a deployment of Ansible Automation Platform deployment purchased through AWS Marketplace. Red&#160;Hat configures and provisions an Ansible Automation Platform. The Red&#160;Hat team handles the setup and maintenance of the Ansible Automation Platform, ensuring reliability and security.

While Red&#160;Hat manages the control plane, the execution plane is spread across your domains using automation mesh hop nodes and execution nodes.
For help with configuring execution nodes see
Automation mesh for managed cloud or operator environments.

There are two ways to configure the communication between control nodes and execution nodes:

* The PULL connectivity model (recommended)
* The PUSH connectivity model
