# Provisioning Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure

When you initiate the deployment of the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform managed app from Azure marketplace, a form is displayed in the Create Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure window.

Before you fill in the form, decide whether you want to create a public or private deployment of Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure:

* Public deployments allow ingress to the Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure user interfaces over the public internet. No configuration is required to access the application URLs.
* Private deployments are created in an isolated Azure VNet that blocks access from the public internet. To access Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure user interfaces, you must configure network peering and routing.

You create the network configuration for the Ansible Automation Platform on Microsoft Azure VNet when you initiate the deployment.
Refer to your network configuration plan before deploying the managed application.
