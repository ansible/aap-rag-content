# Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform best practices

This section covers Ansible Automation Platform product use that has specific content or context for using Ansible Automation Platform as a service.

# Configure automation to use instance groups

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Service on AWS requires that customers implement their own automation execution plane.
Job templates must use a customer-configured instance or container group to run.
If omitted, job runs can seem non-functional and eventually time out due to automation execution failure.
Each job template must be assigned to a customer-configured instance group to function.

# Syncing content with private automation hub

Private automation hub allows you to attempt to sync all content between automation hub or Ansible Galaxy.
However, this synchronization fails due to the storage and resource demands of such a large task.
When syncing content from external sources, limit the synchronization to the collections your organization plans to use, focusing on recent or known used versions to reduce the synchronization scope.
