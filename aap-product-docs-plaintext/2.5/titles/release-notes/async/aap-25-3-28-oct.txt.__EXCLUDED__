# Ansible Automation Platform patch release October 28, 2024

The following enhancements and bug fixes have been implemented in this release of Ansible Automation Platform.

# Enhancements

## Ansible Automation Platform

* With this update, upgrades from Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 to 2.5 are supported for RPM and Operator-based deployments. For more information on how to upgrade, see RPM upgrade and migration. (ANSTRAT-809)
* Upgrades from 2.4 Containerized Ansible Automation Platform Tech Preview to 2.5 Containerized Ansible Automation Platform are unsupported at this time.
* Upgrades for Event-Driven Ansible are unsupported from Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 to Ansible Automation Platform 2.5.

## Ansible Automation Platform Operator

* An informative redirect page is now shown when you go to the automation hub URL root. (AAP-30915)

## Container-based Ansible Automation Platform

* The TLS Certificate Authority private key can now use a passphrase. (AAP-33594)
* Automation hub is populated with container images (decision and execution environments) and Ansible collections. (AAP-33759)
* The automation controller, Event-Driven Ansible, and automation hub legacy UIs now display a redirect page to the Platform UI rather than a blank page. (AAP-33794)

## RPM-based Ansible Automation Platform

* Added platform Redis to RPM-based Ansible Automation Platform. This allows a 6 node cluster for a Redis high availability (HA) deployment. Removed the variable aap_caching_mtls and replaced it with redis_disable_tls and redis_disable_mtls which are boolean flags that disable Redis server TLS and Redis client certificate authentication. (AAP-33773)
* An informative redirect page is now shown when going to automation controller, Event-Driven Ansible, or automation hub URL. (AAP-33827)

# Bug fixes

## Ansible Automation Platform

* Removed the Legacy external password option from the Authentication Type list. (AAP-31506)
* Ansible Galaxy's sessionauth class is now always the first in the list of authentication classes so that the platform UI can successfully authenticate. (AAP-32146)
* CVE-2024-10033 - automation-gateway: Fixed a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the automation-gateway component that allowed a malicious user to perform actions that impact users.
* CVE-2024-22189 - receptor: Resolved an issue in quic-go that would allow an attacker to trigger a denial of service by sending a large number of NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames that retire old connection IDs.

## Automation controller

* CVE-2024-41989 - automation-controller: Before this update, in Django, if floatformat received a string representation of a number in scientific notation with a large exponent, it could lead to significant memory consumption. With this update, decimals with more than 200 digits are now returned as is.
* CVE-2024-45230 - automation-controller: Resolved an issue in Python's Django urlize() and urlizetrunc() functions where excessive input with a specific sequence of characters would lead to denial of service.

## Automation hub

* Refactored the dynaconf hooks to preserve the necessary authentication classes for Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 deployments. (AAP-31680)
* During role migrations, model permissions are now re-added to roles to preserve ownership. (AAP-31417)

## Ansible Automation Platform Operator

* The port is now correctly set when configuring the platform gateway cache redis_host setting when using an external Redis cache. (AAP-33279)
* Added checksums to the automation hub deployments so that pods are cycled to pick up changes to the PostgreSQL configuration and galaxy server settings Kubernetes secrets. (AAP-33518)

## Container-based Ansible Automation Platform

* Fixed the uninstall playbook execution when the environment was already uninstalled. (AAP-32981)
