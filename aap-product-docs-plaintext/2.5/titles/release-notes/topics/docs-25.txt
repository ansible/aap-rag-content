# Ansible Automation Platform documentation

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 documentation includes significant feature updates as well as documentation enhancements and offers an improved user experience.

The following are documentation enhancements in Ansible Automation Platform 2.5:

* The Setting up an automation controller token chapter that previously existed has been deprecated and replaced with the Setting up a Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform credential topic. As the Event-Driven Ansible controller is now integrated with centralized authentication and the Platform UI, this method simplifies the authentication process required for rulebook activations moving forward.
* Documentation changes for 2.5 reflect terminology and product changes. Additionally, we have consolidated content into fewer documents.

The following table summarizes title changes for the 2.5 release.
