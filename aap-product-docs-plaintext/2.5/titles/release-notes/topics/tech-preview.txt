# Technology Preview

Technology Preview features are not supported with Red&#160;Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
Red&#160;Hat does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red&#160;Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.

The following are Technology Preview features:

* Starting with Ansible Automation Platform 2.4, the Platform Resource Operator can be used to create the following resources in automation controller by applying YAML to your OpenShift cluster:
* Inventories
* Projects
* Instance Groups
* Credentials
* Schedules
* Workflow Job Templates
* Launch Workflows

You can now configure the Controller Access Token for each resource with the connection_secret parameter, rather than the tower_auth_secret parameter. This change is compatible with earlier versions, but the tower_auth_secret parameter is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
