# Overview of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform simplifies the development and operation of automation workloads for managing enterprise application infrastructure lifecycles. Ansible Automation Platform works across multiple IT domains, including operations, networking, security, and development, as well as across diverse hybrid environments. Simple to adopt, use, and understand, Ansible Automation Platform provides the tools needed to rapidly implement enterprise-wide automation, no matter where you are in your automation journey.

## What is included in the Ansible Automation Platform



## Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform life cycle

Red Hat provides different levels of maintenance for each Ansible Automation Platform release. For more information, see Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Life Cycle.

# New features and enhancements

## Installation changes

Starting with Ansible Automation Platform 2.5, three different on-premise deployment models are fully tested. In addition to the existing RPM-based installer and operator, support for the containerized installer is being added.

As the platform moves toward a container-first model, the RPM-based installer will be removed in a future release, and a deprecation warning is being issued with the release of Ansible Automation Platform 2.5. While the RPM installer will still be supported for Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 until it is removed, the investment will focus on the container-based installation for RHEL deployments and the operator-based installation for OpenShift deployments. Upgrades from 2.4 containerized Ansible Automation Platform Technology Preview to 2.5 containerized Ansible Automation Platform are unsupported at this time.

## Deployment topologies

Red Hat tests Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 with a defined set of topologies to provide you with opinionated deployment options. While it is possible to install the Ansible Automation Platform on different infrastructure topologies and with different environment configurations, Red Hat guarantees support for the topologies outlined in the following table.

At the time of the Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 GA release, a limited set of topologies are fully tested. Red Hat will regularly add new topologies to iteratively expand the scope of fully tested deployment options. As new topologies roll out, we will include them in the release notes.

The following table shows the tested topologies for Ansible Automation Platform 2.5:



For more information, see {URLTopologies}[Tested deployment models].

## Unified UI

In versions before 2.5, the Ansible Automation Platform was split into three primary services: automation controller, automation hub, and Event-Driven Ansible controller. Each service included standalone user interfaces, separate deployment configurations, and separate authentication schemas.

In Ansible Automation Platform 2.5, the platform gateway is provided as a service that handles authentication and authorization for the Ansible Automation Platform. With the platform gateway, all services that make up the Ansible Automation Platform are consolidated into a single unified UI. The unified UI provides a single entry into the Ansible Automation Platform and serves the platform user interface to authenticate and access all of the Ansible Automation Platform services from a single location.

### Terminology changes

The Unified UI highlights the functional benefits provided by each underlying service. New UI terminology aligns to earlier names as follows:

* Automation execution provides functionality from the automation controller service
* Automation decisions provides functionality from the Event-Driven Ansible service
* Automation content provides functionality from the automation hub service

## Event-Driven Ansible functionality (Automation decisions)

With Ansible Automation Platform 2.5, Event-Driven Ansible functionality has been enhanced with the following features:

* Enterprise single-sign on and role-based access control are available through a new Ansible Automation Platform UI, which enables a single point of authentication and access to all functional components as follows:
* Automation Execution (automation controller)
* Automation Decision (Event-Driven Ansible)
* Automation Content (automation hub)
* Automation Analytics
* Access Management
* Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed
* Simplified event routing capabilities introduce event streams. Event streams are an easy way to connect your sources to your rulebooks. This new capability lets you create a single endpoint to receive alerts from an event source and then use the events in multiple rulebooks. This simplifies rulebook activation setup, reduces maintenance demands, and helps lower risk by eliminating the need for additional ports to be open to external traffic.
* Event-Driven Ansible in the Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 now supports horizontal scalability and enables high-availability deployments of the Event-Driven Ansible controller. These capabilities allow for the installation of multiple Event-Driven Ansible nodes and thus enable you to create highly available deployments.
* Migration to the new platform-wide Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform credential type replaces the legacy controller token for enabling rulebook activations to call jobs in the automation controller.
* Event-Driven Ansible now has the ability to manage credentials that can be added to rulebook activations. These credentials can be used in rulebooks to authenticate to event sources. In addition, you can now attach vault credentials to rulebook activations so that you can use vaulted variables in rulebooks. Encrypted credentials and vaulted variables enable enterprises to secure the use of Event-Driven Ansible within their environment.
* New modules are added to the ansible.eda collection to enable users to automate the configuration of the Event-Driven Ansible controller using Ansible playbooks.

## Event-Driven Ansible 2.5 with automation controller 2.4

You can use a newly installed version of Event-Driven Ansible from Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 with some existing versions of the automation controller. A hybrid configuration is supported with the following versions:

* 2.4 Ansible Automation Platform version of automation controller (4.4 or 4.5)
* 2.5 Ansible Automation Platform version of Event-Driven Ansible (1.1)

You can only use new installations of Event-Driven Ansible in this configuration. RPM-based hybrid deployments are fully supported by Red Hat. For details on setting up this configuration, see the chapter Installing Event-Driven Ansible controller 1.1 and configuring automation controller 4.4 or 4.5 in the Using Event-Driven Ansible 2.5 with Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 guide.

A hybrid configuration means you can install a new Event-Driven Ansible service and configure rulebook activations to execute job templates on a 2.4 version of the automation controller.

## Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment

Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant is a generative AI service that helps automation teams create, adopt, and maintain Ansible content more efficiently; it is now available as an on-premise deployment on the Ansible Automation Platform 2.5.

The on-premise deployment provides the Ansible Automation Platform customers more control over their data and supports compliance with enterprise security policies. For example, organizations in sensitive industries with data privacy or air-gapped requirements can use on-premise deployments of both Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed and IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on Cloud Pak for Data. Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployments are supported on Ansible Automation Platform 2.5. For more information, see the chapter Setting up Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment in the Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant User Guide.

## Ansible plug-ins for Red Hat Developer Hub

The Ansible plug-ins for Red Hat Developer Hub deliver an Ansible-first Red Hat Developer Hub user experience that simplifies creating Ansible content, such as playbooks and collections, for Ansible users of all skill levels. The Ansible plug-ins provide curated content and features to accelerate Ansible learner onboarding and streamline Ansible use case adoption across your organization.

The Ansible plug-ins provide the following capabilities:

* A customized home page and navigation tailored to Ansible users
* Curated Ansible learning paths to help users new to Ansible
* Software templates for creating Ansible playbooks and collection projects that follow best practices
* Links to supported development environments and tools with opinionated configurations

For more information, see the Ansible plug-ins for Red Hat Developer Hub documentation.

## Ansible development tools

Ansible development tools is a suite of tools provided with the Ansible Automation Platform to help automation creators create, test, and deploy playbook projects, execution environments, and collections on Linux, MacOS, and Windows platforms. Consolidating core Ansible tools into a single package simplifies tool management and promotes recommended practices in the automation content creation experience.

Ansible development tools are distributed in an RPM package for RHEL systems, and in a supported container distribution that can be used on Linux, Mac, and Windows OS.

Ansible development tools comprise the following tools:

* ansible-builder
* ansible-core
* ansible-lint
* ansible-navigator
* ansible-sign
* Molecule
* ansible-creator
* ansible-dev-environment
* pytest-ansible
* tox-ansible

For more information, see Developing Ansible automation content.

* Allowed adjustment of RuntimeDirectorySize for Podman environments at the time of installation. (AAP-11597)
* Added support for the SAFE_PLUGINS_FOR_PORT_FORWARD setting for eda-server to the installation program. (AAP-21503)
* Aligned inventory content to tested topologies and added comments for easier access to groups and variables when custom configurations are required. (AAP-30242)
* The variable automationedacontroller_allowed_hostnames is no longer needed and is no longer supported for Event-Driven Ansible installations. (AAP-24421)
* The eda-server now opens the ports for a rulebook with a source plugin that requires inbound connections only if that plugin is allowed in the settings. (AAP-17416)
* The Event-Driven Ansible settings are now moved to a dedicated YAML file. (AAP-13276)
* Starting with Ansible Automation Platform 2.5, customers using the controller collection (ansible.controller) have the platform collection (ansible.platform) as a single point of entry, and must use the platform collection to seed organizations, users, and teams. (AAP-31517)
* Users are opted in for Automation Analytics by default when activating automation controller on first time log in. (ANSTRAT-875)

# Deprecated features

Deprecated functionality is still included in Ansible Automation Platform and continues to be supported during this version&#8217;s support cycle. However, the functionality will be removed in a future release of Ansible Automation Platform and is not recommended for new deployments.

The following table provides information about features that were deprecated in Ansible Automation Platform 2.5:



## Deprecated API endpoints

API endpoints that will be removed in a future release either because their functionality is being removed or superseded with other capabilities. For example, with the platform moving to a centralized authentication system in the platform gateway, the existing authorization APIs in the automation controller and automation hub are being deprecated for future releases as all authentication operations should occur in the platform gateway.



# Removed features

Removed features are those that were deprecated in earlier releases. They are now removed from the Ansible Automation Platform, and will no longer be supported.

The following table provides information about features that are removed in Ansible Automation Platform 2.5:



# Changed features

Changed features are not deprecated and will continue to be supported until further notice.

The following table provides information about features that are changed in Ansible Automation Platform 2.5:



# Known issues

This section provides information about known issues in Ansible Automation Platform 2.5.

## Ansible Automation Platform

* Added the podman_containers_conf_logs_max_size variable for containers.conf to control the max log size for Podman installations. The default value is 10 MiB. (AAP-12295)
* Setting the pg_host= value without any other context no longer results in an empty HOST section of the settings.py in the automation controller. As a workaround, delete the pg_host= value or set it to pg_host=''. (AAP-31915)
* Using Prompt on launch for variables for job templates, workflow job templates, workflow visualizer nodes, and schedules will not show the default variables when launching the job, or when configuring the workflows and schedules. (AAP-30585)
* The unused ANSIBLE_BASE_ settings are included as environment variables in the job execution. These variables suffixed with SECRET are no longer used in the Ansible Automation Platform and might be ignored until they are removed in a future patch. (AAP-32208)

## Event-Driven Ansible

* mTLS event stream creation should be disallowed on all installation methods by default. It is currently disallowed on OpenShift Container Platform installation, but not disallowed in the containerized installations or on RPM installations. (AAP-31337)
* If a primary Redis node enters a failed state and a new primary node is promoted, Event-Driven Ansible workers and scheduler are unable to reconnect to the cluster. This causes activations to fail until the containers or pods are recycled. (AAP-30722)
For more information, see the KCS article Redis failover causes Event-Driven Ansible activation failures.

## Ansible plug-ins for Red Hat Developer Hub

* Python VS Code extension v2024.14.1 does not work in OpenShift Dev Spaces version 1.9.3, prohibiting the Ansible VS Code extension from loading. As a workaround, downgrade the Python VS Code extension version to 2024.12.3.
* The Ansible Content Creator Get Started page links do not work in OpenShift Dev Spaces version 1.9.3. As a workaround, use the Ansible VS Code Command Palette to access the features.

* Fixed Event-Driven Ansible nginx configuration for custom HTTPS port. (AAP-16000)
* Instead of the target service only, all Event-Driven Ansible services are enabled after installation is completed. The Event-Driven Ansible services will always start after the setup is complete. (AAP-15889)

## Ansible Automation Platform Operator

* Fixed Django REST Framework (DRF) browsable views. (AAP-25508)

# Ansible Automation Platform documentation

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 documentation includes significant feature updates as well as documentation enhancements and offers an improved user experience.

The following are documentation enhancements in Ansible Automation Platform 2.5:

* The Setting up an automation controller token chapter that previously existed has been deprecated and replaced with the Setting up a Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform credential topic.

The following enhancements and bug fixes have been implemented in this release of Ansible Automation Platform.

### Enhancements

* With this release, a redirect page has now been implemented that will be exhibited when you navigate to the root / for each component's stand-alone URL. The API endpoint remains functional. This affects Event-Driven Ansible, automation controller, Ansible Automation Platform Operator, and OpenShift Container Platform.

### Bug fixes

#### General

With this update, the following CVEs have been addressed:

CVE-2024-9902 ansible-core: Ansible-core user may read/write unauthorized content.

CVE-2024-8775 ansible-core: Exposure of sensitive information in Ansible vault files due to improper logging.

#### Ansible Automation Platform

* Fixed an issue where the user was unable to filter out hosts on inventory groups where it returned a Failed to load options on Ansible Automation Platform UI.

#### Execution Environment

#### Ansible Automation Platform Operator

* Fixed a syntax error when bundle_cacert_secret was defined due to incorrect indentation.
* Fixed an issue where the default operator catalog for Ansible Automation Platform aligned to cluster-scoped versus namespace-scoped.
* Added the ability to set tolerations and node_selector for the Redis statefulset and the gateway deployment.
* Ensure the platform URL status is set when Ingress is used to resolve an issue with Microsoft Azure on Cloud managed deployments. This is due to the Ansible Automation Platform operator failing to finish because it is looking for OpenShift Container Platform routes that are not available on Azure Kubernetes Service.
* Fixed an issue where the Ansible Automation Platform Operator description did not render code block correctly.
* It is necessary to specify the CONTROLLER_SSO_URL and AUTOMATION_HUB_SSO_URL settings in Gateway to fix the OIDC auth redirect flow.
* It is necessary to set the SERVICE_BACKED_SSO_AUTH_CODE_REDIRECT_URL setting to fix the OIDC auth redirect flow.

#### container-based installation Ansible Automation Platform

* Fixed an issue when the port value was not defined in the gateway_main_url variable, the containerized installer failed with incorrect execution environment image reference error.
* Fixed an issue where the containerized installer used port number when specifying the image_url for a decision environment. The user should not add a port to image URLs when using the default value.

#### RPM-based Ansible Automation Platform

* Fixed an issue where not setting up the gpg agent socket properly when multiple hub nodes are configured resulted in not creating a gpg socket file in /var/run/pulp.

#### Ansible development tools

* Fixed an issue where missing data files were not included in the molecule RPM package.

#### Automation controller

* CVE-2024-41989 - automation-controller: Before this update, in Django, if floatformat received a string representation of a number in scientific notation with a large exponent, it could lead to significant memory consumption. With this update, decimals with more than 200 digits are now returned as is.
* CVE-2024-45230 - automation-controller: Resolved an issue in Python's Django urlize() and urlizetrunc() functions where excessive input with a specific sequence of characters would lead to denial of service.

#### Automation hub

* Refactored the dynaconf hooks to preserve the necessary authentication classes for Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 deployments. (AAP-31680)
* During role migrations, model permissions are now re-added to roles to preserve ownership. (AAP-31417)

#### Ansible Automation Platform Operator

* The port is now correctly set when configuring the platform gateway cache redis_host setting when using an external Redis cache. (AAP-33279)
* Added checksums to the automation hub deployments so that pods are cycled to pick up changes to the PostgreSQL configuration and galaxy server settings Kubernetes secrets. (AAP-33518)

* Fixed a faulty conditional which was causing managed Redis to be deployed even if an external Redis was being configured. (AAP-31607)
* After the initial deployment of Ansible Automation Platform, if you make changes to the automation controller, automation hub, or Event-Driven Ansible sections of the Ansible Automation Platform CR specification, those changes are now propagated to the component custom resources. (AAP-32350)
* Fixed addressing issues when the filter keep_keys is used, all keys are removed from the dictionary. The keepkey fix is available in the updated ansible.utils collection. (AAP-32960)
* Fixed an issue in cisco.ios.ios_static_routes where the metric distance is to be populated in the forward_router_address attribute. (AAP-32960)
* Fixed an issue where Ansible Automation Platform Operator is not transferring metric settings to the controller. (AAP-32073)
* Fixed an issue where you have a schedule on a resource, such as a job template, that prompts for credentials, and you update the credential to be different from what is on the resource by default, the new credential is not submitted to the API and it does not get updated. (AAP-31957)
* Fixed an issue where setting *pg_host= without any other context no longer results in an empty HOST section of settings.py in controller. (AAP-32440)
