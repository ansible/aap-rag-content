# About Automation Calculator

The automation calculator provides graphs, metrics and calculations that help you determine the total savings on your investment in automated processes.

Automation savings is produced by an analysis of the time and cost of performing a task manually, such as deploying a server, versus the time and cost associated with automating the same task. Automation savings calculations extend across all organizations, clusters, hosts and templates in an environment. Include your own estimated costs to produce a more accurate calculation.


[NOTE]
----
The initial total savings is based on default values for each variable.
----

Several variables are used in evaluating costs:

* Manual cost of automation - the approximate cost for a mid-level resource to perform a task or series of tasks.
* Cost of automation - costs associated with automating tasks as job templates.
* Automation time - the time required to run a job template.
* Number of hosts - the number of hosts in inventory the template runs on.

Automation savings is based on the following formulas:

* Manual cost per template = (time for a manual run on one host * (sum of all hosts across job runs)) * cost per hour.
* Automation cost per template = cost of automation per hour * sum of total elapsed hours for a template.
* Savings = sum of (manual cost - automation costs) across all templates.

## Calculating your automation savings

The Automation Calculator produces its default total savings figure based on estimates for each variable.

You can tune this calculation by providing more specific organizational cost information and adjusting the time values for each of the top templates. The total savings updates dynamically as you edit each field.


[NOTE]
----
Automation savings calculations are not saved in Red Hat Automation Analytics.
----

To calculate your automation savings:

1. Under Calculate your automation enter cost information for:
1. Manual process cost
2. Automated process cost
2. Under Top templates:
1. Adjust time values for top templates to provide time to manually perform each task that the template automates.

Total savings updates based on the information you enter in each field.

## Top templates

Top templates lists the 25 most frequently run templates across all hosts in your environment. Templates are listed in descending order starting with the highest run count. You can enter the time it takes to perform tasks manually that are automated by templates in the field adjacent to the run totals to produce a more accurate total savings. The default value is set to 60 minutes.

### Curating top templates

You can use the toggle switch for each template to show or hide it in the bar graph to compare performance and savings based on specific templates.

* Click the toggle switch for each template to display or hide it.

The bar graph on the Automation Calculator will update to display those top templates selected and Total savings will calculate based on those templates.

### Viewing template details

You can view detailed information for each template in Top templates to learn more about the template&#8217;s context in the calculation of automation savings.

* Click the Info icon for a job template to view template details.

* Total elapsed sum - Total run time of the template.
* Success elapsed sum - Total run time for successful template runs.
* Failed elapsed sum - Total run time for failed template runs.
* Automation percentage - The template accounts for this percentage of automation in your organization.
* Associated organizations - The template runs against these organizations.
* Associated clusters - Automation controller clusters the template runs on.

# About the automation savings planner

An automation savings plan gives you the ability to plan, track, and analyze the potential efficiency and cost savings of your automation initiatives. Use automation analytics to create an automation savings plan by defining a list of tasks needed to complete an automation job. You can then link your automation savings plans to an Ansible job template in order to accurately measure the time and cost savings upon completion of an automation job.

To create an automation savings plan, you can utilize the automation savings planner to prioritize the various automation jobs throughout your organization and understand the potential time and cost savings for your automation initiatives.

## Creating a new automation savings plan

Create an automation savings plan by defining the tasks needed to complete an automation job using the automation savings planner.

## Review savings calculations for your automation plans

The automation savings planner offers a calculation of how much time and money you can save by automating a job. automation analytics takes data from the plan details and the associated job template to provide you with an accurate projection of your cost savings when you complete this savings plan.

To do so, navigate to your savings planner page, click the name of an existing plan, then navigate to the Statistics tab.

The statistics chart displays a projection of your monetary and time savings based on the information you provided when creating a savings plan. Primarily, the statistics chart subtracts the automated cost from the manual cost of executing the plan to provide the total resources saved upon automation. The chart then displays this data by year to show you the cumulative benefits for automating the plan over time.

Click between Money and Time to view the different types of savings for automating the plan.

## Filter and sort plans on the list view page

Find specific types of automation savings plans by filtering or sorting your savings planner list view.
