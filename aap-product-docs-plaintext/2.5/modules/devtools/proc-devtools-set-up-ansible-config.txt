# Setting up the Ansible configuration file for your playbook project

When you scaffolded your playbook project, an Ansible configuration file, ansible.cfg,
was added to the root directory of your project.

If you have configured a default Ansible configuration file in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg,
copy any settings that you want to reuse in your project from your default Ansible configuration file
to the ansible.cfg file in your project&#8217;s root directory.

To learn more about the Ansible configuration file, see
Ansible Configuration Settings
in the Ansible documentation.
