# Removing the Sidecar container from the RHDH Custom Resource ConfigMap

If you added extra configuration to the ConfigMap where you added the sidecar container (rhdh-custom-config in our example), then you cannot remove the reference to the ConfigMap from the RHDH Custom Resource.

Instead, you must remove only the YAML code relating to the sidecar from the ConfigMap.


```
Add YAML code
