# Discovering existing Ansible content for RHEL system roles

Red Hat recommends that you use trusted automation content that has been tested and approved by Red Hat or your organization.

Automation hub is a central repository for discovering, downloading, and managing trusted content collections from Red Hat and its partners.
Private automation hub provides an on-premise solution for managing content collections.

1. Click on the Ansible A icon in the Red Hat Developer Hub navigation panel.
2. Click Discover existing collections.
3. Click Go to Automation Hub.
* If private automation hub has been configured in the Ansible plug-ins, you are redirected to your PrivateHubName instance.
* If private automation hub has not been configured in the Ansible plug-ins installation configuration,
you will be redirected to the Red Hat Hybrid Console (RHCC) automation hub.

In this example, you are redirected to the RHCC automation hub.
4. If you are prompted to log in, provide your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials.
5. Filter the collections with the rhel firewall keywords.

The search returns the rhel_system_roles collection.

The RHEL System Roles collection contains certified Ansible content that you can reuse to configure your firewall.
