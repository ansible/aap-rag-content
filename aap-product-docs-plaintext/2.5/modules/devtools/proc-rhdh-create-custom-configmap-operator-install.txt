# Creating a custom Operator ConfigMap

Create a custom ConfigMap, for instance rhdh-custom-config, for your project.
For more details about creating a custom ConfigMap, see the
Adding a custom application configuration file to OpenShift Container Platform using the Operator
in the Administration guide for Red Hat Developer Hub.

Populate the ConfigMap with YAML from the backup that you made of the RHDH Operator ConfigMap.

* You have saved a backup copy of the Configmap for the RHDH Operator.

1. In the OpenShift web console, navigate to the project you created.
2. Click ConfigMaps in the navigation pane.
3. Click Create ConfigMap.
4. Replace the default YAML code in the new ConfigMap with the following code:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: rhdh-custom-config
data:
  deployment.yaml: |-
    # Replace with RHDH Operator ConfigMap deployment.yaml block here
```

5. Copy the deployment.yaml: section from your local copy of the RHDH Operator ConfigMap.
6. Paste the deployment.yaml: section into the rhdh-custom-config ConfigMap, replacing the deployment.yaml: line.
7. Add a sidecar container (ansible-devtools-server)  to the list of containers under resources in the deployment.spec.template.spec.[containers] block of the ConfigMap:

```
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         rhdh.redhat.com/app:
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           rhdh.redhat.com/app:
       spec:\
           ...
           containers:
           - name: backstage-backend
		...
           - resources: {}  # Add sidecar container for Ansible plug-ins
             terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
             name: ansible-devtools-server
             command:
               - adt
               - server
             ports:
               - containerPort: 8000
                 protocol: TCP
             imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
             terminationMessagePolicy: File
             image: 'ghcr.io/ansible/community-ansible-dev-tools:latest'
```

8. Click btn:[Create] to create the ConfigMap.

To view your new ConfigMap, click ConfigMaps in the navigation pane.
