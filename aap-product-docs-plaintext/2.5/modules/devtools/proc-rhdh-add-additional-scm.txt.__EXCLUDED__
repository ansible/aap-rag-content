# Adding additional Source Control Management options

The standard Ansible plug-ins templates are preconfigured to support GitHub Cloud.
Follow the procedure below to add support for additional Source Control Management (SCM) solutions.

1. Create a fork of the Ansible plug-ins software templates repository.
2. In your repository, update the enum and enumNames keys with the SCM values.
3. Update the software template action to match your SCM type.
4. Register the forked repository with your customized templates in Red Hat Developer Hub.

For example, if you wanted to add GitLab as an SCM, your software template file would look similar to the following:


```
...
spec:
  ...
  parameters:
    ...
      properties:
        sourceControl:
          title: Select source control option
          type: string
          description: Select the source control option for your Ansible project.
          default: gitlab.com
          enum:
            - gitlab.com
          enumNames:
            - 'GitLab'
...
```


Under the steps section, use the appropriate action for your SCM:


```
  steps:
  ...
    - id: publish
      name: Publish
      action: publish:gitlab
  ...
```
