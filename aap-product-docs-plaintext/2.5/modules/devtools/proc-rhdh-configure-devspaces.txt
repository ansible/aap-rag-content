# Configuring OpenShift Dev Spaces

When OpenShift Dev Spaces is configured for the Ansible plug-ins, users can click a link from the catalog item view in Red Hat Developer Hub and edit their provisioned Ansible Git projects using Dev Spaces.


[NOTE]
----
OpenShift Dev Spaces is a separate product and it is optional.
The plug-ins will function without it.
It is a separate Red Hat product and is not included in the Ansible Automation Platform or Red Hat Developer Hub subscription.

If the OpenShift Dev Spaces link is not configured in the Ansible plug-ins,
the Go to OpenShift Dev Spaces dashboard link in the DEVELOP section of the Ansible plug-ins landing page redirects users to the
Ansible development tools home page.
