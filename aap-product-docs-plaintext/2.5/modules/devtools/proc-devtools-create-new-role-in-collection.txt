# Creating a new role in your collection

1. To create a new role, copy the default run role directory that was scaffolded when you created the collection.
2. Define the tasks that you want your role to perform in the tasks/main.yml file.
If you are creating a role to reuse tasks in an existing playbook,
copy the content in the tasks block of your playbook YAML file.
Remove the whitespace to the left of the tasks.
Use ansible-lint in VS Code to check your YAML code.
3. If your role depends on another role, add the dependency in the meta/main.yml file.
