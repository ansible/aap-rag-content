# Updating the plug-in registry

Rebuild your plug-in registry application in your OpenShift cluster with the latest Ansible plug-ins files.

1. Log in to your OpenShift Container Platform instance with credentials to create a new application.
2. Open your Red Hat Developer Hub OpenShift project.

```
$ oc project <YOUR_DEVELOPER_HUB_PROJECT>
```

3. Run the following commands to update your plug-in registry build in the OpenShift cluster.

```
$ oc start-build plugin-registry --from-dir=$DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_ROOT_DIR --wait
```

4. When the registry has started, the output displays the following message:

```
Uploading directory "/path/to/dynamic_plugin_root" as binary input for the build â€¦
Uploading finished
build.build.openshift.io/plugin-registry-1 started
```


Verify that the plugin-registry has been updated.

1. In the OpenShift UI, click Topology.
2. Click the redhat-developer-hub icon to view the pods for the plug-in registry.
3. Click View logs for the plug-in registry pod.
4. Open the Terminal tab and run ls to view the .tar files in the plug-in registry.
5. Verify that the new .tar file has been uploaded.
