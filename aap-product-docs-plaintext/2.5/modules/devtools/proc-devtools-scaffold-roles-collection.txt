# Scaffolding a collection for your roles

You can scaffold a collection for your roles from the Ansible extension in VS Code.

1. Open VS Code.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your roles collection.
3. Click the Ansible icon in the VS Code activity bar to open the Ansible extension.
4. Select Get started in the Ansible content creator section.

The Ansible content creator tab opens.
5. In the Create section, click Ansible collection project.

The Create new Ansible project tab opens.
6. In the form in the Create Ansible project tab, enter the following:
* Namespace: Enter a name for your namespace, for example company_namespace.
* Collection: Enter a name for your collection, for example, myapp_network.
* Init path: Enter the path to the directory where you want to scaffold your new collection.

If you enter an existing directory name, the scaffolding process overwrites the contents of that directory.
The scaffold process only allows you to use an existing directory if you enable the Force option.
* If you are using the containerized version of Ansible development tools,
the destination directory path is relative to the container, not a path in your local system.
To discover the current directory name in the container, run the pwd command in a terminal in VS Code.
If the current directory in the container is workspaces, enter workspaces/<current_project>/collections.
* If you are using a locally installed version of Ansible Dev tools,
enter the full path to the directory, for example /user/<username>/path/to/<collection_directory>.
7. Click btn:[Create].

The following message appears in the Logs pane of the Create Ansible collection tab.


```
