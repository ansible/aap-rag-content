# Creating a registry for the Ansible plug-ins

Set up a registry in your OpenShift cluster to host the Ansible plug-ins and make them available for installation in Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH).

1. Log in to your OpenShift Container Platform instance with credentials to create a new application.
2. Open your Red Hat Developer Hub OpenShift project.

```
$ oc project <YOUR_DEVELOPER_HUB_PROJECT>
```

3. Run the following commands to create a plug-in registry build in the OpenShift cluster.

```
$ oc new-build httpd --name=plugin-registry --binary
$ oc start-build plugin-registry --from-dir=$DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_ROOT_DIR --wait
$ oc new-app --image-stream=plugin-registry
```


To verify that the plugin-registry was deployed successfully, open the Topology view in the Developer perspective on the Red Hat Developer Hub application in the OpenShift Web console.

1. Click the plug-in registry to view the log.

2. Click the terminal tab and login to the container.
3. In the terminal, run ls to confirm that the .tar files are in the plugin registry.
