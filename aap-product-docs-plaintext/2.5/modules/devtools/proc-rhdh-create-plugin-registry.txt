# Creating a plug-in registry

Set up a plug-in registry in your OpenShift cluster to host the Ansible plug-ins and make them available for installation in Red Hat Developer Hub.

1. Log in to your OpenShift Container Platform instance with credentials to create a new application.
2. Open your Red Hat Developer Hub OpenShift project.

```
$ oc project <YOUR_DEVELOPER_HUB_PROJECT>
```

3. Run the following commands to create a plug-in registry build in the OpenShift cluster.

```
$ oc new-build httpd --name=plugin-registry --binary
$ oc start-build plugin-registry --from-dir=$DYNAMIC_PLUGIN_ROOT_DIR --wait
$ oc new-app --image-stream=plugin-registry
```


To verify that the plugin-registry was deployed successfully, open the Topology view in the Developer perspective on the Red Hat Developer Hub application in the OpenShift Web console.

1. Click the plug-in registry to view the log.
