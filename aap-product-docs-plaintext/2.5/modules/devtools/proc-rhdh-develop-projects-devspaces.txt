# Developing projects on Dev Spaces

OpenShift Dev Spaces
is not included with your Ansible Automation Platform subscription or the Ansible plug-ins for Red Hat Developer Hub.

The plug-ins provide context-aware links to edit your project in Dev Spaces.

The Dev Spaces instance provides a default configuration that installs the Ansible VS Code extension and provides the Ansible command line tools.
You can activate Ansible Lightspeed in the Ansible VS Code extension. For more information, refer to the
Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant User Guide.
