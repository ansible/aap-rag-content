# Configuring the private automation hub URL

Private automation hub provides a centralized, on-premise repository for certified Ansible collections, execution environments and any additional, vetted content provided by your organization.

If the private automation hub URL is not configured in the Ansible plug-ins, users are redirected to the
Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console automation hub.
