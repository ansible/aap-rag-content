# Backing up your RHDH Operator ConfigMap

Before you install Ansible plug-ins for Red Hat Developer Hub, create a local copy of the ConfigMap for the RHDH Operator.
You can use a section of the ConfigMap when you are populating a custom ConfigMap.

1. Find the namespace for your RHDH Operator.

When you installed the RHDH Operator, a namespace was created for it.
Select Topology and look for the RHDH Operator in the Project dropdown list.
The default namespace is rhdh-operator.
2. Run the following command to make a copy of the ConfigMap for your RHDH Operator, backstage-default-config.

Replace <rhdh-operator-namespace> with your RHDH Operator namespace, and <CopyOfRhdhOperatorConfig> with
the filename you want to use for your copy of the RHDH Operator.

```
$ oc get configmap backstage-default-config -n <rhdh-operator-namespace> -o yaml > <CopyOfRhdhOperatorConfig>
```
