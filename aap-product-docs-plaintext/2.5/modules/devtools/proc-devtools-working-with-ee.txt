# Working with execution environments

You can view the automation execution environments provided by Red Hat in the
Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog.

Click on an execution environment for information on how to download it.

1. Log in to registry.redhat.io if you have not already done so.

[NOTE]
----
If you are running Ansible development tools on a container inside VS Code and you want to pull execution environments
or the devcontainer to use as an execution environment,
you must log in to registry.redhat.io from a terminal prompt within the devcontainer inside VS Code.
----
2. Using the information in the
Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog, download the execution environment you need.

For example, to download the minimal RHEL 8 base image, run the following command:

```
$ podman pull registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/ee-minimal-rhel9
```


You can build and create custom execution environments with ansible-builder.
For more information about working with execution environments locally, see
Creating and using execution environments.

After customizing your execution environment, you can push your new image to the container registry in automation hub. See
Publishing an automation execution environment
in the Creating and using execution environments documentation.
