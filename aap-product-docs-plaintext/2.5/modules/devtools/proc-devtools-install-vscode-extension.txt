# Installing the VS Code Ansible extension

The Ansible extension adds language support for Ansible to VS Code.
It incorporates Ansible development tools to facilitate creating and running automation content.

For a full description of the Ansible extension, see the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

See Learning path - Getting Started with the Ansible VS Code Extension for tutorials on working with the extension.

To install the Ansible VS Code extension:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Click the Extensions () icon in the Activity Bar, or click menu:View[Extensions], to display the Extensions view.
3. In the search field in the Extensions view, type Ansible Red Hat.
4. Select the Ansible extension and click btn:[Install].

When the language for a file is recognized as Ansible, the Ansible extension provides features such as auto-completion, hover, diagnostics, and goto.
The language identified for a file is displayed in the Status bar at the bottom of the VS Code window.

The following files are assigned the Ansible language:

* YAML files in a /playbooks directory
* Files with the following double extension: .ansible.yml or .ansible.yaml
* Certain YAML names recognized by Ansible, for example site.yml or site.yaml
* YAML files whose filename contains "playbook": playbook.yml or playbook.yaml

If the extension does not identify the language for your playbook files as Ansible, follow the procedure in
Associating the Ansible language to YAML files.
