# Adding the Ansible Developer Tools container

You must update the Helm chart configuration to add an extra container.

1. Log in to the OpenShift UI.
2. Navigate to menu:Helm[developer-hub > Actions > upgrade > Yaml view] to open the Helm chart.
3. Update the extraContainers section in the YAML file.

Add the following code:

```
upstream:
  backstage:
    ...
    extraContainers:
      - command:
          - adt
          - server
        image: >-
          registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/ansible-dev-tools-rhel8:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: ansible-devtools-server
        ports:
          - containerPort: 8000
    ...
```


[NOTE]
----
The image pull policy is imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent.
The image is pulled only if it does not already exist on the node.
Update it to imagePullPolicy: Always if you always want to use the latest image.

4. Click btn:[Upgrade].

To verify that the container is running, check the container log:
