# Discovering existing collections

From the Overview page in the Ansible plug-ins dashboard on Red Hat Developer Hub, click Discover Existing Collections.

The links in this pane provide access to the source of reusable automation content collections that you configured during plug-in installation.

If you configured private automation hub when installing the plug-in, you can click Go to Automation Hub to view the collections and execution environments that your enterprise has curated.

If you did not configure a private automation hub URL when installing the plug-in, the Discover existing collection pane provides a link to Red Hat automation hub on console.redhat.com.
You can explore certified and validated Ansible content collections on this site.
