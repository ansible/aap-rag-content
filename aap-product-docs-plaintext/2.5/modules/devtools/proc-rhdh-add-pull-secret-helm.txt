# Adding a pull secret to the Red Hat Developer Hub Helm configuration

The Ansible Development Container download requires a Red Hat Customer Portal account and Red Hat Service Registry account.

1. Create a new Red Hat Registry Service account, if required.
2. Click the token name under the Account name column.
3. Select the OpenShift Secret tab and follow the instructions to add the pull secret to your Red Hat Developer Hub OpenShift project.
4. Add the new secret to the Red Hat Developer Hub Helm configuration, replacing <your-redhat-registry-pull-secret> with the name of the secret you generated on the Red Hat Registry Service Account website:

```
upstream:
  backstage:
    ...
    image:
      ...
      pullSecrets:
        - <your-redhat-registry-pull-secret>
    ...
```
