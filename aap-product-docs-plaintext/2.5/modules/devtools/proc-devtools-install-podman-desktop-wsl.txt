# Requirements for Ansible development tools on Windows

If you are installing Ansible development tools on a container in VS Code on Windows, there are extra requirements:
* Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL2)
* Podman Desktop

# Installing WSL

1. Install WSL2 without a distribution:

```
$ `wsl --install --no-distribution`
```

2. Use cgroupsv2 by disabling cgroupsv1 for WSL2:

Edit the %USERPROFILE%/wsl.conf file and add the following lines to force cgroupv2 usage:

```
[wsl2]
kernelCommandLine = cgroup_no_v1="all"
```


# Installing Podman Desktop on a Windows machine

1. Install Podman Desktop. Follow the instructions in
Installing Podman Desktop and Podman on Windows
in the Podman Desktop documentation.

You do not need to change the default settings in the set-up wizard.
2. Ensure the podman machine is using cgroupsv2:

```
$ podman info | findstr cgroup
```

3. Test Podman Desktop:

```
$ podman run hello
```


# Configuring settings for Podman Desktop

1. Add a %USERPROFILE%\bin\docker.bat file with the following content:

```
@echo off
podman %*
```


This avoids having to install Docker as required by the VS Code Dev Container extension.
2. Add the %USERPROFILE%\bin directory to the PATH.
1. Select Settings and search for "Edit environment variables for your account" to display all of the user environment variables.
2. Highlight "Path" in the top user variables box, click btn:[Edit] and add the path.
3. Click btn:[Save] to set the path for any new console that you open.
