# Authenticating with the Red Hat container registry

All container images available through the Red Hat container catalog are hosted on an image registry,
registry.redhat.io.
The registry requires authentication for access to images.

To use the registry.redhat.io registry, you must have a Red Hat login.
This is the same account that you use to log in to the Red Hat Customer Portal (access.redhat.com) and manage your Red Hat subscriptions.


[NOTE]
----
If you are planning to install the Ansible development tools on a container inside VS Code,
you must log in to registry.redhat.io before launching VS Code so that VS Code can pull the
devtools container from registry.redhat.io.
If you are running Ansible development tools on a container inside VS Code and you want to pull execution environments
or the devcontainer to use as an execution environment,
you must log in from a terminal prompt within the devcontainer from a terminal inside VS Code.
----

You can use the podman login or docker login commands with your credentials to access content on the registry.

Podman:: 

```
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
Username: my__redhat_username
Password: ***********
```

Docker:: 

```
$ docker login registry.redhat.io
Username: my__redhat_username
Password: ***********
```
