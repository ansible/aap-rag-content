# Configuring Ansible Automation Platform details

The Ansible plug-ins query your Ansible Automation Platform subscription status with the controller API using a token.


[NOTE]
----
The Ansible plug-ins continue to function regardless of the Ansible Automation Platform subscription status.
----

1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with “Read” scope in automation controller, following the
Applications
section of Access management and authentication.
2. Edit your custom Red Hat Developer Hub config map, for example app-config-rhdh.
3. Add your Ansible Automation Platform details to app-config-rhdh.yaml.
1. Set the baseURL key with your automation controller URL.
2. Set the token key with the generated token value that you created in Step 1.
3. Set the checkSSL key to true or false.

If checkSSL is set to true, the Ansible plug-ins verify whether the SSL certificate is valid.

```
data:
  app-config-rhdh.yaml: |
    ...
    ansible:
    ...
      rhaap:
        baseUrl: '<https://MyControllerUrl>'
        token: '<AAP Personal Access Token>'
        checkSSL: true
```



[NOTE]
----
You are responsible for protecting your Red Hat Developer Hub installation from external and unauthorized access.
Manage the backend authentication key like any other secret.
Meet strong password requirements, do not expose it in any configuration files, and only inject it into configuration files as an environment variable.
