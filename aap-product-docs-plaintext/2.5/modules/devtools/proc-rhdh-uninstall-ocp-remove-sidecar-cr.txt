# Removing the custom resource ConfigMap from the RHDH Operator Custom Resource

If you created a custom resource ConfigMap
as described in the Creating a custom Operator ConfigMap
and you added only the Ansible development tools sidecar container to it, then you can remove the reference to the ConfigMap from the RHDH Custom Resource.


[NOTE]
----
Ensure that you do not have any additional need for the custom ConfigMap before you remove it from the Custom Resource.

1. In the OpenShift console, select the Topology view.
2. Click More actions &#8942; on the RHDH Operator Custom Resource and select Edit backstage to edit the Custom Resource.
3. Remove the ConfigMap reference from the RHDH Operator Custom Resource.
For this example, the ConfigMap name is rhdh-custom-config.

	...
 database:
  	...
 rawRuntimeConfig: # Remove the backstageConfigâ€™ YAML key below
   backstageConfig: rhdh-custom-config
```
