When you are developing your roles, you can use ansible-lint in the Ansible
extension to display potential rule violations in the terminal in VS Code.
When you package your collection and install it into your playbook projects,
the code extension autocomplete feature is available for your collection.
If you have your Ansible collection PATH set, you can use Ansible Navigator
to browse your collection and its contents.
Use ansible-navigator to run your playbooks because it is useful for troubleshooting.
