# Custom resources

You can define custom resources for each primary installation workflows.

# Modifying the number of simultaneous rulebook activations during or after Event-Driven Ansible controller installation

* If you plan to install Event-Driven Ansible on OpenShift Container Platform and modify the number of simultaneous rulebook activations, add the required EDA_MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS parameter to your custom resources. By default, Event-Driven Ansible controller allows 12 activations per node to run simultaneously. See the example in appendix EDA_MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS.


[NOTE]
----
EDA_MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS for OpenShift Container Platform is a global value since there is no concept of worker nodes when installing Event-Driven Ansible on OpenShift Container Platform.
