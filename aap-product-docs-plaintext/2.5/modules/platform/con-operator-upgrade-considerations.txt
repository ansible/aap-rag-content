# Upgrade considerations

If you are upgrading from version 2.4, continue to the Upgrading the Ansible Automation Platform Operator.

If your OpenShift Container Platform version is not supported by the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform version you are upgrading to, you must upgrade your OpenShift Container Platform cluster to a supported version first.

Refer to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Life Cycle to determine the OpenShift Container Platform version needed.

For information about upgrading your cluster, refer to Updating clusters.
