# Upgrading the Ansible Automation Platform Operator

To upgrade to the latest version of Ansible Automation Platform Operator on OpenShift Container Platform, you can do the following:

* Read the Release notes for 2.5
* [Optional] You need to deploy all of your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform services (automation controller, automation hub, Event-Driven Ansible) to the same, single namespace before upgrading to 2.5 (only for existing deployments). For more information see, Migrating from one namespace to another.
* Review the Backup and recovery for operator environments guide and backup your services:
* AutomationControllerBackup
* AutomationHubBackup
* EDABackup

1. Log in to OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
3. Select the Ansible Automation Platform Operator installed on your project namespace.
4. Select the Subscriptions tab.
5. Change the channel from stable-2.4 to stable-2.5. An InstallPlan is created for the user.
6. Click btn:[Preview InstallPlan].
7. Click btn:[Approve].
8. Create a Custom Resource (CR) using the Ansible Automation Platform UI.
The automation controller and automation hub UIs remain until all SSO configuration is supported in the platform gateway UI.
