# Attaching your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription

You must have valid subscriptions attached on all nodes before installing Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. Attaching your Ansible Automation Platform subscription provides access to subscription-only resources necessary to proceed with the installation.

1. Make sure your system is registered:

```
$ sudo subscription-manager register --username <$INSERT_USERNAME_HERE> --password <$INSERT_PASSWORD_HERE>
```

2. Obtain the pool_id for your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription:

```
$ sudo subscription-manager list --available --all | grep "Ansible Automation Platform" -B 3 -A 6
```


[NOTE]
----
Do not use MCT4022 as a pool_id for your subscription because it can cause Ansible Automation Platform subscription attachment to fail.
----
Example

An example output of the subsciption-manager list command. Obtain the pool_id as seen in the Pool ID: section:

```
Subscription Name: Red Hat Ansible Automation, Premium (5000 Managed Nodes)
  Provides: Red Hat Ansible Engine
  Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
  SKU: MCT3695
  Contract: ````
  Pool ID: <pool_id>
  Provides Management: No
  Available: 4999
  Suggested: 1
```

3. Attach the subscription:

```
$ sudo subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
```


You have now attached your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscriptions to all nodes.
4. To remove this subscription, enter the following command:

```
$ sudo subscription-manager remove --pool=<pool_id>
```


* Verify the subscription was successfully attached:


```
$ sudo subscription-manager list --consumed
```
