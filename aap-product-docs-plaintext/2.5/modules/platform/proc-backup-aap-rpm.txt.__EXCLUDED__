# Backing up RPM-based Ansible Automation Platform

Back up an existing Ansible Automation Platform instance by running the setup.sh script with the backup_dir flag, which saves the content and configuration of your current environment:

1. Go to your Ansible Automation Platform installation directory.
2. Run the setup.sh script following the example below:

```
$ ./setup.sh -e 'backup_dir=/ansible/mybackup' -e 'use_compression=True' @credentials.yml -b
```

* backup_dir specifies a directory to save your backup to.
* @credentials.yml passes the password variables and their values that are encrypted by ansible-vault.

With a successful backup, a backup file is created at /ansible/mybackup/<platform_installation_directory_name>.tar.gz.
