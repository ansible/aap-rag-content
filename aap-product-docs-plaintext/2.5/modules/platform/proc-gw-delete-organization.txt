# Deleting an organization

Before you can delete an organization, you must be an Organization administrator or System administrator. When you delete an organization, the organization, team, users and resources are permanently removed from Ansible Automation Platform.


[NOTE]

When you attempt to delete items that are used by other resources, a message is displayed warning you that the deletion might impact other resources and prompts you to confirm the deletion. Some screens contain items that are invalid or have been deleted previously, and will fail to run.
