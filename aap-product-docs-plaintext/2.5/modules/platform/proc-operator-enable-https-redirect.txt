# Enabling HTTPS redirect for single sign-on (SSO) for platform gateway on OpenShift Container Platform

HTTPS redirect for SAML, allows you to log in once and access all of the platform gateway without needing to reauthenticate.

* You have successfully configured SAML in the gateway from the Ansible Automation Platform Operator. Refer to Configuring SAML authentication for help with this.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Go to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
3. Select your Ansible Automation Platform Operator deployment.
4. Select All Instances and go to your AnsibleAutomationPlatform instance.
5. Click the  &#8942; icon and then select btn:[Edit AnsibleAutomationPlatform].
6. In the YAML view paste the following YAML code under the spec: section:

```
spec:
  extra_settings:
    - setting: REDIRECT_IS_HTTPS
      value: '"True"'
```

7. Click btn:[Save].

After you have added the REDIRECT_IS_HTTPS setting, wait for the pod to redeploy automatically. You can verify this setting makes it into the pod by running:


```
oc exec -it <gateway-pod-name> -- grep REDIRECT /etc/ansible-automation-platform/gateway/settings.py
```
