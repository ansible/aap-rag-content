# Adding users to a team

The following tab selections are available when adding users to a team. When user accounts from automation controller or automation hub organizations have been migrated to Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 during the upgrade process, the Automation Execution and Automation Content tabs show content based on whether the users were added to those organizations prior to migration.

Ansible Automation Platform:: Reflects all users added to the organization at the platform level. From this tab, you can add users as organization members and, optionally provide specific organization level roles.
Automation Execution:: Reflects users that were added directly to the automation controller organization prior to an upgrade and migration. From this tab, you can only view existing memberships in automation controller and remove those memberships but you can not add new memberships. New organization memberships must be added through the platform.
Automation Content:: Reflects users that were added directly to the automation hub organization prior to an upgrade and migration. From this tab, you can only view existing memberships in automation hub and remove those memberships but you can not add new memberships.

New user memberships to a team must be added at the platform level.
