# Ansible Automation Platform installation on disconnected RHEL

You can install Ansible Automation Platform without an internet connection by using the installer-managed database located on the automation controller. The setup bundle is recommended for disconnected installation because it includes additional components that make installing Ansible Automation Platform easier in a disconnected environment. These include the Ansible Automation Platform Red Hat package managers (RPMs) and the default execution environment (EE) images.
