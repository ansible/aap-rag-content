# Preparing the Red Hat Enterprise Linux host for containerized installation

Containerized Ansible Automation Platform runs the component services as Podman based containers on top of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux host. Prepare the Red Hat Enterprise Linux host to ensure a successful installation.

1. Log in to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux host as your non-root user.
2. Set a hostname that is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN):

```
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <your_hostname>
```

3. Register your Red Hat Enterprise Linux host with subscription-manager:

```
sudo subscription-manager register
```

4. Run sudo dnf repolist to validate that only the BaseOS and AppStream repositories are setup and enabled on the host:

```
$ sudo dnf repolist
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
repo id                                                    repo name
rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms                           Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMs)
rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms                              Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)
```

5. Ensure that only these repositories are available to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux host. For more information about managing custom repositories, see:
Managing custom software repositories.
6. Ensure that the host has DNS configured and can resolve host names and IP addresses by using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This is essential to ensure services can talk to one another.
7. Install ansible-core:

```
sudo dnf install -y ansible-core
```

8. Optional: You can install additional utilities that can be useful for troubleshooting purposes, for example wget, git-core, rsync, and vim:

```
sudo dnf install -y wget git-core rsync vim
```

9. Optional: To have the installer automatically pick up and apply your Ansible Automation Platform subscription manifest license, follow the steps in Obtaining a manifest file.
