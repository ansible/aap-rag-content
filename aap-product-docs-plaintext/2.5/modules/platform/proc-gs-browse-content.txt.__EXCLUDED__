Ansible Certified Content Collections are included in your subscription to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.
Using Ansible automation hub, you can access and curate a unique set of collections from all forms of Ansible content.

Red Hat Ansible content contains two types of content:

* Ansible Certified Content Collections
* Ansible validated content collections

Ansible validated content collections are available in your private automation hub through the Platform Installer.
When you download Ansible Automation Platform with the bundled installer, validated content is pre-populated into the private automation hub by default,
but only if you enable the private automation hub as part of the inventory.

If you are not using the bundle installer, you can use a Red Hat-supplied Ansible Playbook to install validated content.
For further information, see Ansible validated content.

You can update validated collections manually by downloading their updated packages in automation hub.
