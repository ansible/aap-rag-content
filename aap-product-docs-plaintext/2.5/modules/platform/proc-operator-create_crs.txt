# Creating Ansible Automation Platform custom resources

Create an Ansible Automation Platform custom resource (CR) that specifies the names of your existing deployments, in the same namespace.

You can find examples for Ansible Automation Platform CR for various deployment scenarios in the Appendix.

1. For example, use the fresh install Ansible Automation Platform CR (aap-fresh-install.yml).
2. Wait for the Ansible Automation Platform CR to show the Successful status.
3. Navigate to the Route URL listed in the status (or the Routes page) to access the new CR.


[NOTE]
----
You can override the operatorâ€™s default image for automation controller, automation hub, or platform-resource app images by specifying the preferred image on the YAML spec.
This enables upgrading a specific deployment, like a controller, without updating the operator.
The recommended approach however, is to upgrade the operator and use the default image values.
