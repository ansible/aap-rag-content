# Creating Ansible Automation Platform custom resources

After upgrading to the latest version of Ansible Automation Platform Operator on OpenShift Container Platform, you can create an Ansible Automation Platform custom resource (CR) that specifies the names of your existing deployments, in the same namespace.

This example outlines the steps to deploy a new Event-Driven Ansible setup after upgrading to the latest version, with existing automation controller and automation hub deployments already in place.

The Appendix contains more examples of Ansible Automation Platform CRs for different deployments.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
3. Select your Ansible Automation Platform Operator deployment.
4. Select the Details tab.
5. On the Ansible Automation Platform tile click btn:[Create instance].
6. From the Create Ansible Automation Platform page enter a name for your instance in the Name field.
7. Click btn:[YAML view] and paste the following YAML (aap-existing-controller-and-hub-new-eda.yml):

```
---
apiVersion: aap.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: AnsibleAutomationPlatform
metadata:
  name: myaap
spec:
  # Development purposes only
  no_log: false

  controller:
    name: existing-controller #obtain name from controller CR
    disabled: false

  eda:
    disabled: false

  hub:
    name: existing-hub
    disabled: false
```

8. Click btn:[Create].


[NOTE]
----
You can override the operatorâ€™s default image for automation controller, automation hub, or platform-resource app images by specifying the preferred image on the YAML spec.
This enables upgrading a specific deployment, like a controller, without updating the operator.
The recommended approach however, is to upgrade the operator and use the default image values.

Navigate to your Ansible Automation Platform Operator deployment and click btn:[All instances] to verify whether all instances have deployed correctly.
You should see the Ansible Automation Platform instance and the deployed AutomationController, EDA, and AutomationHub instances here.

Alternatively, you can verify whether all instances deployed correctly by running oc get route in the command line.
