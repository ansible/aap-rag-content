# Setting up the inventory file

Before upgrading your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installation, edit the inventory file so that it matches your desired configuration.
You can keep the same parameters from your existing Ansible Automation Platform deployment or you can modify the parameters to match any changes to your environment.

You can find sample inventory files in the Test topologies GitHub repository, or in our Tested deployment models guide.

1. Navigate to the installation program directory.
Bundled installer:: 

```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.5-4-x86_64
```

Online installer:: 

```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-2.5-4
```

2. Open the inventory file for editing.
3. Modify the inventory file to provision new nodes, deprovision nodes or groups, and import or generate automation hub API tokens.

You can use the same inventory file from an existing Ansible Automation Platform installation if there are no changes to the environment.

[NOTE]
----
Provide a reachable IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for all hosts to ensure that users can synchronize and install content from Ansible automation hub from a different node.
Do not use localhost.
If localhost is used, the upgrade will be stopped as part of preflight checks.
----

* Add new nodes alongside existing nodes in the inventory file as follows:

```ini
[automationcontroller]
clusternode1.example.com
clusternode2.example.com
clusternode3.example.com

[all:vars]
admin_password='password'

pg_host='<host_name>'

pg_database='<database_name>'
pg_username='<your_username>'
pg_password='<your_password>'
```
