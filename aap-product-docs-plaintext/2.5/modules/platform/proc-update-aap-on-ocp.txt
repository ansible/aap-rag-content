# Updating Ansible Automation Platform on OpenShift Container Platform

Perform a patch update for an installation of Ansible Automation Platform on OpenShift Container Platform.

Most updates happen within a channel:

1. A new update becomes available in the marketplace (through the redhat-operator CatalogSource).
2. A new InstallPlan is automatically created for your Ansible Automation Platform subscription. If the subscription is set to Manual, the InstallPlan will need to be manually approved in the OpenShift UI. If the subscription is set to Automatic, it will upgrade as soon as the new version is available.

[NOTE]
----
It is recommended that you set a manual install strategy on your Ansible Automation Platform Operator subscription (set when installing or upgrading the Operator) and you will be prompted to approve an upgrade when it becomes available in your selected update channel. Stable channels for each X.Y release (for example, stable-2.5) are available.

3. A new Subscription, CSV, and Operator containers will be created alongside the old Subscription, CSV, and containers. Then the old resources will be cleaned up if the new install was successful.
