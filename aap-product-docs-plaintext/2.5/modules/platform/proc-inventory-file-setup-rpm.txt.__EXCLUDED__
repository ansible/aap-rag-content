# Setting up the inventory file

Before upgrading your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installation, edit the inventory file so that it matches your desired configuration. You can keep the same parameters from your existing Ansible Automation Platform deployment or you can modify the parameters to match any changes to your environment.

1. Navigate to the installation program directory.

Bundled installer

```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-<version_number>-<arch_version>
```


Online installer

```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-<version_number>
```

2. Update the inventory file to match your desired configuration. You can use the same inventory file from an existing Ansible Automation Platform installation if there are no changes to the environment.


[NOTE]
----
Provide a reachable IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for all hosts to ensure that users can synchronize and install content from Ansible automation hub from a different node. Do not use localhost. If localhost is used, the upgrade will be stopped as part of preflight checks.
