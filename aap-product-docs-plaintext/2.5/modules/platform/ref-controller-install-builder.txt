# Install ansible-builder

To build images, you must have Podman or Docker installed, along with the ansible-builder Python package.

The --container-runtime option must correspond to the Podman or Docker executable you intend to use.

When building an execution environment image, it must support the architecture that Ansible Automation Platform is deployed with.

For more information, see Quickstart for Ansible Builder, or Creating and consuming execution environments.
