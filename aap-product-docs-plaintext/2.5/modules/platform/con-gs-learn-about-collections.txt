# About content collections

Ansible content collections are assemblages of automation content. There are two types of Ansible collections:

* Ansible Certified Content Collections, which contain fully-supported roles and modules that are enterprise- and production-ready for use in your environments.
* Ansible validated content collections, which provide you with a trusted, expert-guided approach for performing foundational operations and tasks in your product.

Both types of content collections can be found in automation hub through the Hybrid Cloud Console.
