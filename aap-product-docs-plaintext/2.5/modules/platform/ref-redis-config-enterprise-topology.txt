# Configuring Redis

Ansible Automation Platform offers a centralized Redis instance in both standalone and clustered topologies.

In RPM deployments, the Redis mode is set to cluster by default. You can change this setting in the inventory file [all:vars] section as in the following example:


```
[all:vars]
admin_password='<password>'
pg_host='data.example.com'
pg_port='5432'
pg_database='awx'
pg_username='awx'
pg_password='<password>'
pg_sslmode='prefer'  # set to 'verify-full' for client-side enforced SSL

registry_url='registry.redhat.io'
registry_username='<registry username>'
registry_password='<registry password>'

redis_mode=cluster
```
