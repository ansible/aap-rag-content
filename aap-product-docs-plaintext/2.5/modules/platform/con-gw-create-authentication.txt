# Creating an authentication method

The Create Authentication wizard guides you through the steps to create a new authentication method for your organization. The wizard is launched during the create authentication process.

Creating an authenticator involves the following procedures:

1. Authentication type, where you select the type of authenticator plugin you want to configure.
2. Authentication details, where you configure the authentication details for the plugin you selected.
3. Mapping, where you define mapping rule types and triggers to control access to the system.
4. Mapping order, where you can define the mapping precedence.

[NOTE]
----
Mapping order is only available if you have defined one or more authenticator maps.
----
5. Review, where you can review and confirm the authentication settings before creating the authentication method.
