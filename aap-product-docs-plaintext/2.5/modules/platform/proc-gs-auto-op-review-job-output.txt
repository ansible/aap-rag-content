# Reviewing job output

When you relaunch a job, the jobs Output view is displayed.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Jobs].
2. Select a job. This takes you to the Output view for that job, where you can filter job output by these criteria:
* The Search output option allows you to search by keyword.
* The Event option enables you to filter by the events of interest, such as errors, host failures, host retries, and items skipped. You can include as many events in the filter as necessary.
