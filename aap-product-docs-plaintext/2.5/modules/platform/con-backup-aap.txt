# Back up your Ansible Automation Platform instance

Back up an existing Ansible Automation Platform instance by running the .setup.sh script with the backup_dir flag, which saves the content and configuration of your current environment.

1. Navigate to your Ansible Automation Platform installation directory.
2. Run the ./setup.sh script following the example below:

```
$ ./setup.sh -e ‘backup_dir=/ansible/mybackup’ -e ‘use_compression=True’ @credentials.yml -b 1
```

backup_dir specifies a directory to save your backup to.

With a successful backup, a backup file is created at /ansible/mybackup/automation-platform-backup-<date/time>.tar.gz .
