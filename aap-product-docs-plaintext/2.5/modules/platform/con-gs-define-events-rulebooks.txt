# Define events with rulebooks

An Ansible rulebook is a collection of rulesets that references one or more sources, rules, and conditions.
Rulebooks are to Event-Driven Ansible what playbooks are to Ansible Automation Platform as a whole.
Like a playbook, a rulebook defines automation tasks for the platform, along with when they should be triggered.

# Rulebook actions

Rulebooks use an "if-this-then-that‚Äù logic that tells Event-Driven Ansible what actions to activate when a rule is triggered. Event-Driven Ansible listens to the controller event stream and, when an event triggers a rule, activates an automation action in response.

Rulebooks can trigger the following activations:

* run_job_template
* run_playbook (only supported with ansible-rulebook CLI)
* debug
* print_event
* set_fact
* post_event
* retract_fact
* shutdown

To read more about rulebook activations, see Actions in the Ansible Rulebook documentation.
