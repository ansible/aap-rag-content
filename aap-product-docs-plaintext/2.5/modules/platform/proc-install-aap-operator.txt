1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Operators[OperatorHub].
3. Search for Ansible Automation Platform and click btn:[Install].
4. Select an Update Channel:
* stable-2.x: installs a namespace-scoped operator, which limits deployments of automation hub and automation controller instances to the namespace the operator is installed in. This is suitable for most cases. The stable-2.x channel does not require administrator privileges and utilizes fewer resources because it only monitors a single namespace.
* stable-2.x-cluster-scoped: deploys automation hub and automation controller across multiple namespaces in the cluster and requires administrator privileges for all namespaces in the cluster.
5. Select Installation Mode, Installed Namespace, and Approval Strategy.
6. Click btn:[Install].

The installation process begins. When installation finishes, a modal appears notifying you that the Ansible Automation Platform Operator is installed in the specified namespace.

* Click btn:[View Operator] to view your newly installed Ansible Automation Platform Operator.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can only install a single instance of the Ansible Automation Platform Operator into a single namespace.
Installing multiple instances in the same namespace can lead to improper operation for both operator instances.
