# Migration considerations

If you are upgrading from any version of Ansible Automation Platform older than 2.4, you must upgrade through Ansible Automation Platform first.
If you are on OpenShift Container Platform 3 and you want to upgrade to OpenShift Container Platform 4, you must provision a fresh OpenShift Container Platform version 4 cluster and then migrate the Ansible Automation Platform to the new cluster.
