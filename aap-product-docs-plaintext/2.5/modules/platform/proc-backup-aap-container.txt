# Backing up container-based Ansible Automation Platform

Perform a back up of your container-based installation of Ansible Automation Platform.

1. Go to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installation directory on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux host.
2. Run the backup playbook command:

```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible.containerized_installer.backup
```


This will backup the important data deployed by the containerized installer such as:
* PostgreSQL databases
* Configuration files
* Data files

By default, the backup directory is set to ~/backups. You can change this by using the backup_dir variable in your inventory file.
