# Node counting in licenses

The Ansible Automation Platform license defines the number of Managed Nodes that can be managed as part of your subscription.

A typical license says "License Count: 500", which sets the maximum number of Managed Nodes at 500.

For more information about managed node requirements for licensing, see How are "managed nodes" defined as part of the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform offering.


[NOTE]

Ansible does not recycle node counts or reset automated hosts.
