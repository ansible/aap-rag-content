# Amazon Web Services EC2

Use the following procedure to configure an AWS EC2-sourced inventory.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Inventories].
2. Select the inventory name you want a source to and click the Sources tab.
3. Click btn:[Create source].
4. In the Create source page, select Amazon EC2 from the Source list.
5. The Create source window expands with additional fields.
Enter the following details:
* Optional: Credential: Choose from an existing AWS credential.
For more information, see Managing user credentials.

If automation controller is running on an EC2 instance with an assigned IAM Role, the credential can be omitted, and the security credentials from
the instance metadata are used instead.
For more information about using IAM Roles, see IAM roles for Amazon EC2_documentation_at_Amazon documentation at Amazon.
6. Optional: You can specify the verbosity, host filter, enabled variables or values, and update options as described in
Adding a source.
7. Use the Source variables field to override variables used by the aws_ec2 inventory plugin.
Enter variables by using either JSON or YAML syntax.
Use the radio button to toggle between the two.
For more information about these variables, see the
aws inventory plugin documentation.


[NOTE]
----
If you only use include_filters, the AWS plugin always returns all the hosts.
To use this correctly, the first condition on the or must be on filters and then build the rest of the OR conditions on a list of
include_filters.
