# Uploading a collection to automation hub

If you want to share a collection that you have created with the rest of the Ansible community, you can upload it to automation hub.


[NOTE]
----
Sharing a collection with the Ansible community requires getting the collection certified or validated by our Partner Engineering team. This action is available only to partner clients. For more about becoming a partner, see our documentation on software certification.

You can upload your collection by using either the automation hub user interface or the ansible-galaxy client.

* You have configured the ansible-galaxy client for automation hub.
* You have at least one namespace.
* You have run all content through ansible-test sanity

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Namespaces].
2. Within the My namespaces tab, locate and click into the namespace to which you want to upload a collection.
3. Select the Collections tab, and then click btn:[Upload collection].
4. In the New collection modal, click Select file. Locate the file on your system.
5. Click btn:[Upload].

Using the ansible-galaxy client, enter the following command:


```bash
$ ansible-galaxy collection publish path/to/my_namespace-my_collection-1.0.0.tar.gz --api-key=SECRET
```
