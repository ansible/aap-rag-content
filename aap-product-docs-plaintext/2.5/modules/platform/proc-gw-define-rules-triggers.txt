# Defining authentication mapping rules and triggers

Authentication map types can be used with any type of authenticator. Each map has a trigger that defines when the map should be evaluated as true.

1. Click btn:[Add authentication mapping] to see the list of available map types and select the map type you want to create. See Authenticator map types for detailed descriptions of the different map types. Choices include:
* Allow
* Organization
* Team
* Role
* Is Superuser
2. Enter a unique rule Name to identify the rule.
3. Select a Trigger from the list. See Authenticator map triggers for more details. Choices include:
* Always
* Never
* Group
* Attribute
4. Repeat steps 1-3 to add additional triggers to the authenticator.
5. Click btn:[Next] to optionally Adjust the Mapping order.

[NOTE]
----
The mapping order setting is only available if there is more than one authenticator map defined.
