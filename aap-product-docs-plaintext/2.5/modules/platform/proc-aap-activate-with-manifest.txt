After your subscription has been accepted, subscription details are displayed. A status of Compliant indicates your subscription is in compliance with the number of hosts you have automated within your subscription count. Otherwise, your status will show as Out of Compliance, indicating you have exceeded the number of hosts in your subscription.
Other important information displayed include the following:
Hosts automated:: Host count automated by the job, which consumes the license count
Hosts imported:: Host count considering all inventory sources (does not impact hosts remaining)
Hosts remaining:: Total host count minus hosts automated
