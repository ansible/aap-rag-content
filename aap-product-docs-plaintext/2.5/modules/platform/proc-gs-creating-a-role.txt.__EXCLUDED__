# Creating a role

1. In your terminal, navigate to the roles directory inside a collection.
2. Create a role called my_role inside the collection:

```bash
$ansible-galaxy role init my_role
```


The collection now includes a role named my_role inside the roles directory, as you can see in this example:

```bash
~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/<my_namespace>/<my_collection_name>
    ...
    └── roles/
        └── my_role/
            ├── .travis.yml
            ├── README.md
            ├── defaults/
            │   └── main.yml
            ├── files/
            ├── handlers/
            │   └── main.yml
            ├── meta/
            │   └── main.yml
            ├── tasks/
            │   └── main.yml
            ├── templates/
            ├── tests/
            │   ├── inventory
            │   └── test.yml
            └── vars/
                └── main.yml
```

3. A custom role skeleton directory can be supplied by using the --role-skeleton argument. This allows organizations to create standardized templates for new roles to suit their needs.

```bash
$ansible-galaxy role init my_role --role-skeleton ~/role_skeleton
```


This creates a role named my_role by copying the contents of ~/role_skeleton into my_role. The contents of role_skeleton can be any files or folders that are valid inside a role directory.
