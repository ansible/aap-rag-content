# Inventory file recommendations based on installation scenarios

Before selecting your installation method for Ansible Automation Platform, review the following recommendations. Familiarity with these recommendations will streamline the installation process.

* Provide a reachable IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for hosts to ensure users can sync and install content from automation hub from a different node.

The FQDN must not contain either the - or the _ symbols, as it will not be processed correctly.

Do not use localhost.
* admin is the default user ID for the initial log in to Ansible Automation Platform and cannot be changed in the inventory file.
* Use of special characters for pg_password is limited. The !, #, 0 and @ characters are supported. Use of other special characters can cause the setup to fail.
* Enter your Red Hat Registry Service Account credentials in registry_username and registry_password to link to the Red Hat container registry.
* The inventory file variables registry_username and registry_password are only required if a non-bundle installer is used.
