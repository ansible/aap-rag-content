# Installing containerized Ansible Automation Platform

Use the following command to install containerized Ansible Automation Platform:


```
ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file_name> ansible.containerized_installer.install
```


For example:


```
ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible.containerized_installer.install
```


* If your privilege escalation requires you to enter a password, append -K to the command. You are then prompted for the BECOME password.
* You can use increasing verbosity, up to 4 v's (-vvvv) to see the details of the installation process. However, it is important to note that this can significantly increase installation time, so it is recommended that you use it only as needed or requested by Red Hat support.
