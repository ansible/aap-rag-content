# Automation controller and automation hub 2.4 and Event-Driven Ansible 2.5 with unified UI upgrades

Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 supports upgrades from Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 environments for all components, with the exception of Event-Driven Ansible. You can also configure a mixed environment with Event-Driven Ansible from 2.5 connected to a legacy 2.4 cluster. Combining install methods (OCP, RPM, Containerized) within such a topology is not supported by Ansible Automation Platform.

[NOTE]
----
If you are running the 2.4 version of Event-Driven Ansible in production, before you upgrade, contact Red Hat support or your account represenative for more information on how to move to Ansible Automation Platform 2.5.
----
Supported topologies described in this document assume that:
* 2.4 services will only include automation controller and automation hub.
* 2.5 parts will always include Event-Driven Ansible and the unified UI (platform gateway).
* Combining install methods for these topologies is not supported.

# Upgrade considerations

* You must maintain two separate inventory files: one for the 2.4 services and one for the 2.5 services.
* You must maintain two separate "installations" wihtin this scenario: one for the 2.4 services and one for the 2.5 services.
* You must "upgrade" the two separate "installations" separately.
* To upgrade to a consistent component version topology, consider the following:
* You must manually combine the inventory file configuration from the 2.4 inventory into the 2.5 inventory and run upgrade on ONLY the 2.5 inventory file.
* You must be using an external database for both the 2.4 inventory as well as the 2.5 inventory.
* Customers using "managed database" instances for either 2.4 or 2.5 inventory must migrate to an external database first, before upgrading.

* An inventory from 2.4 for automation controller and automation hub and a 2.5 inventory for unified UI (platform gateway) and Event-Driven Ansible. You must run upgrades on 2.4 services (using the inventory file to specify only automation controller and automation hub VMs) to get them to the invitial version of Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 first. When all the services are at the same version, run an upgrade (using a complete inventory file) on all the services to go to the latest version of Ansible Automation Platform 2.5.


[IMPORTANT]
----
DO NOT upgrade Event-Driven Ansible and the unified UI (platform gateway) to the latest version of Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 without first upgrading the individual services (automation controller and automation hub) to the initial version of Ansible Automation Platform 2.5.

## Migration path for 2.4 instances with managed databases

Standalone node managed database

Convert the database node to an external one, removing it from the inventory. The PostgreSQL node will continue working and will not lose the Ansible Automation Platform-provided setup, but you are responsible for managing its configuration afterward.

Collocated managed database

1. Backup
2. Restore with standalone managed database node instead of collocated.
3. Unmanaged standalone database

## Migration path for 2.4 services with 2.5 services

If you installed Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 to use Event-Driven Ansible in a supported scenario, you can upgrade your Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 automation controller and automation hub to Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 by following these steps:

* Merge 2.4 inventory data into the 2.5 inventory. The example below shows the inventory file for automation controller and automation hub for 2.4 and the inventory file for Event-Driven Ansible and the unified UI (platform gateway) for 2.5, respectively, as the starting point, and what the merged inventory looks like.

Inventory files from 2.4


```bash
[automationcontroller]
controller-1
controller-2

[automationhub]
hub-1
hub-2

[all:vars]
# Here we have the admin passwd, db credentials, etc.
```


Inventory files from 2.5


```
[edacontroller]
eda-1
eda-2

[gateway]
gw-1
gw-2

[all:vars]
# Here we have admin passwd, db credentials etc.
```


Merged Inventory


```
[automationcontroller]
controller-1
controller-2

[automationhub]
hub-1
hub-2

[edacontroller]
eda-1
eda-2

[gateway]
gw-1
gw-2

[all:vars]
# Here we have admin passwd, db credentials etc from both inventories above
```


* Run setup.sh
The installer upgrades automation controller and automation hub from 2.4 to Ansible Automation Platform 2.5.latest, Event-Driven Ansible and the unified UI (platform gateway) from the fresh install of 2.5 to the latest version of 2.5, and connects automation controller and automation hub properly with the unified UI (platform gateway) node to initialize the unified experience.

* Verify that everything has upgraded to 2.5 and is working properly in one of two ways:
* performing an SSH to automation controller and Event-Driven Ansible.
* In the unified UI, navigate to Help > About to verify the RPM versions are at 2.5.
