# Setting registry_username and registry_password

When using the registry_username and registry_password variables for an online non-bundled installation, you need to create a new registry service account.

Registry service accounts are named tokens that can be used in environments where credentials will be shared, such as deployment systems.

1. Go to https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/accounts.
2. On the Registry Service Accounts page click btn:[New Service Account].
3. Enter a name for the account using only the allowed characters.
4. Optionally enter a description for the account.
5. Click btn:[Create].
6. Find the created account in the list by searching for your name in the search field.
7. Click the name of the account that you created.
8. Alternatively, if you know the name of your token, you can go directly to the page by entering the URL:

```
https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/token/<name-of-your-token>
```

9. A token page opens, displaying a generated username (different from the account name) and a token.

If no token is displayed, click btn:[Regenerate Token]. You can also click this to generate a new username and token.
10. Copy the username (for example "1234567|testuser") and use it to set the variable registry_username.
11. Copy the token and use it to set the variable registry_password.
