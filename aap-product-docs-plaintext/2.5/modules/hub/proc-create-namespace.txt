3. Click btn:[Create namespace] and enter a Name for your namespace.
4. Optional: enter a description, company, logo URL, resources, or useful links in the appropriate fields.
5. Click btn: [Create namespace].
6. Select the Team Access tab and click btn:[Add roles] to assign roles to your namespace.
7. Select the team to which you want to grant a role, then click btn:[Next].
8. Select the roles you want to apply to the selected team, and then click btn:[Next].
9. Review your selections and click btn:[Finish].
10. Click btn:[Close] to complete the process.

Your content developers can now upload collections to your new namespace and allow users in teams assigned as owners to upload collections.
