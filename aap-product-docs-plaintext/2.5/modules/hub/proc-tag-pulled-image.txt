# Tagging execution environments for use in automation hub

After you pull execution environments from a registry, tag them for use in your private automation hub remote registry.

* You have pulled an execution environment from an external registry.
* You have the FQDN or IP address of the automation hub instance.

* Tag a local execution environment with the automation hub container repository:

```
$ podman tag registry.redhat.io/<ee_name>:<tag> <automation_hub_hostname>/<ee_name>
```


1. List the images in local storage:

```
$ podman images
```

2. Verify that the execution environment you recently tagged with your automation hub information is contained in the list.
