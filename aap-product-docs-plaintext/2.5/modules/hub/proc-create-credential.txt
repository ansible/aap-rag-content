# Creating a credential

To pull automation execution environments images from a password or token-protected registry, you must create a credential.

In earlier versions of Ansible Automation Platform, you were required to deploy a registry to store execution environment images.
On Ansible Automation Platform 2.0 and later, the system operates as if you already have a remote registry up and running.
To store execution environment images, add the credentials of only your selected remote registries.

1. Log in to Ansible Automation Platform.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Credentials].
3. Click btn:[Create credential] to create a new credential.
4. Enter an authorization Name, Description, and Organization.
5. In the Credential Type drop-down, select Container Registry.
6. Enter the Authentication URL. This is the remote registry address.
7. Enter the Username and Password or Token required to log in to the remote registry.
8. Optional: To enable SSL verification, select Verify SSL.
9. Click btn:[Create credential].

Filling in at least one of the fields organization, user, or team is mandatory, and can be done through the user interface.
