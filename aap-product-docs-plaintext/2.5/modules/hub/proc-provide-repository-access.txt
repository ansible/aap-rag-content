2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Repositories].
3. Click into your repository in the list and select the Team Access tab.
4. Click btn:[Add roles].
5. Select the team to which you want to grant a role, then click btn:[Next].
6. Select the roles you want to apply to the selected team, and then click btn:[Next].
7. Review your selections and click btn:[Finish].
8. Click btn:[Close] to complete the process.
