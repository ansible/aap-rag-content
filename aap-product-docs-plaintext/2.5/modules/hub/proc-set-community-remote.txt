# Configuring the community remote repository and syncing Ansible Galaxy collections

You can edit the community remote repository to synchronize chosen collections from Ansible Galaxy to your private automation hub.
By default, your private automation hub community repository directs to galaxy.ansible.com/api/.

* You have Modify Ansible repo content permissions.
For more information on permissions, see Access management and authentication.
* You have a requirements.yml file that identifies those collections to synchronize from Ansible Galaxy as in the following example:
Requirements.yml example

```
collections:
  # Install a collection from Ansible Galaxy.
  - name: community.aws
    version: 5.2.0
    source: https://galaxy.ansible.com
```


1. Log in to Ansible Automation Platform.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Remotes].
3. In the Details tab in the Community remote, click btn:[Edit remote].
4. In the YAML requirements field, paste the contents of your requirements.yml file.
5. Click btn:[Save remote].

You can now synchronize collections identified in your requirements.yml file from Ansible Galaxy to your private automation hub.
6. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Repositories]. Next to the community repository, click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942; and select Sync repository to sync collections between Ansible Galaxy and Ansible automation hub.

The Sync status column updates to notify you whether the Ansible Galaxy collections synchronization to your Ansible automation hub is successful.
