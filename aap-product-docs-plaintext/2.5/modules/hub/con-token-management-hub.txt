# Token management in automation hub

Before you can interact with automation hub by uploading or downloading collections, you must create an API token. The automation hub API token authenticates your ansible-galaxy client to the Red Hat automation hub server.

Your method for creating the API token differs according to the type of automation hub that you are using:

* Automation hub uses offline token management. See Creating the offline token in automation hub.
* Private automation hub uses API token management. See Creating the API token in private automation hub.
* If you are using Keycloak to authenticate your private automation hub, follow the procedure for Creating the offline token in automation hub.
