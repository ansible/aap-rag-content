# Importing an automation content collection in automation hub

As an automation content creator, you can import a collection to use in a custom repository. To use a collection in your custom repository, you must first import the collection into your namespace so the automation hub administrator can approve it.

1. Log in to Ansible Automation Platform.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Namespaces]. The Namespaces page displays all of the namespaces available.
3. Select the namespace to which you want to add your collection.
4. Select the Collections tab.
5. Click btn:[Upload Collection].
6. Enter or browse to select a collection file.
7. Select the repository pipeline to add the collection. The choices are Staging repos and Repositories without pipeline.
8. Click btn:[Upload collection].

The Imports screen displays a summary of tests and notifies you if the collection upload is successful or has failed. To find your imports, on your namespace click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942; and select Imports.

[NOTE]
----
If the collection is not approved, it is not displayed in the published repository.
