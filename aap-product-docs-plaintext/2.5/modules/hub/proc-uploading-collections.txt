# Uploading collections to your namespaces

You can upload internally developed collections in tar.gz file format to your private automation hub namespace for review and approval by an automation hub administrator.
When approved, the collection moves to the Published content repository where automation hub users can view and download it.


[NOTE]
----
Format your collection file name as follows: <my_namespace-my_collection-1.0.0.tar.gz>

* You have a namespace to which you can upload the collection.
