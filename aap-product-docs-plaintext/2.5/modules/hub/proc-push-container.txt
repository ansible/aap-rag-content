# Pushing an execution environment to private automation hub

You can push tagged execution environments to private automation hub to create new containers and populate the remote registry.

* You have permissions to create new containers.
* You have the FQDN or IP address of the automation hub instance.

1. Log in to Podman using your automation hub location and credentials:

```
$ podman login -u=<username> -p=<password> <automation_hub_url>
```


[WARNING]
----
Let Podman prompt you for your password when you log in. Entering your password at the same time as your username can expose your password to the shell history.
----
2. Push your execution environment to your automation hub remote registry:

```
$ podman push <automation_hub_url>/<ee_name>
```


The push operation re-compresses image layers during the upload, which is not guaranteed to be reproducible and is client-implementation dependent.
This may lead to image-layer digest changes and a failed push operation, resulting in Error: Copying this image requires changing layer representation, which is not possible (image is signed or the destination specifies a digest).

1. Log in to your Ansible Automation Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Automation Content[Execution Environments].
3. Locate the container in the container repository list.
