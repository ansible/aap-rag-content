# Container growth topology

The growth topology is intended for organizations that are getting started with Ansible Automation Platform and do not require redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation. This topology allows for smaller footprint deployments.

# Infrastructure topology

The following diagram outlines the infrastructure topology that Red&#160;Hat has tested with this deployment model that customers can use when self-managing Ansible Automation Platform:

![Container growth topology diagram]

A single VM has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS. Resources, such as storage, can be increased based on the needs of the deployment.



# Tested system configurations

Red&#160;Hat has tested the following configurations to install and run Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform:



# Network ports

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.



# Example growth inventory file

Use the example inventory file to perform an installation for this topology:


```yaml
# This is the Ansible Automation Platform installer inventory file intended for the container growth deployment topology.
# This inventory file expects to be run from the host where Ansible Automation Platform will be installed.
# Consult the Ansible Automation Platform product documentation about this topology's tested hardware configuration.

[WARNING]
----
* When installing the growth topology for the Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 containerized setup bundle, you must disable content syncing which is enabled by default. To disable this feature set the hub_seed_collections variable in the inventory file to false. See Container growth topology for a sample inventory file and see Automation hub variables for more information about this inventory file variable.
----

SSH keys are only required when installing on remote hosts. If doing a self contained local VM based installation, you can use ansible_connection=local.
