# Container growth topology

The growth topology is intended for organizations that are getting started with Ansible Automation Platform and do not require redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation. This topology allows for smaller footprint deployments.

# Infrastructure topology

The following diagram outlines the infrastructure topology that Red&#160;Hat has tested with this deployment model that customers can use when self-managing Ansible Automation Platform:

![Container growth topology diagram]

A single VM has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS. Resources, such as storage, can be increased based on the needs of the deployment.



# Tested system configurations

Red&#160;Hat has tested the following configurations to install and run Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform:



# Network ports

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform server for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.



# Example growth inventory file

Use the example inventory file to perform an installation for this topology:


```yaml
# This is the growth installer inventory file
# Please consult the docs if you are unsure what to add
# For all optional variables please consult the included README.md

----
SSH keys are only required when installing on remote hosts. If doing a self contained local VM based installation, you can use ansible_connection=local.
