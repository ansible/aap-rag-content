# Planning considerations

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is composed of the following primary components:

* Automation controller
* Automation mesh
* Private automation hub
* Event-Driven Ansible controller

A PostgreSQL database is also provided, although a user-provided PostgreSQL database can be used as well.
Red Hat recommends that customers always deploy all components of Ansible Automation Platform so that all features and capabilities are available for use without the need to take further action.
