# Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform deployment methods

There are three different installation methods for Ansible Automation Platform:

* RPM-based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
* Container-based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
* Operator-based on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

This document offers guidance on hardening Ansible Automation Platform when installed using either of the first two installation methods (RPM-based or container-based).
This document further recommends using the container-based installation method for new deployments, as the RPM-based installer will be deprecated in a future release.

For further information, see Deprecated features.

Operator-based deployments are out of scope for this document.
