# Ansible Automation Platform authentication

Automation controller currently supports the following external authentication mechanisms through the platform gateway UI:

* Local
* LDAP
* SAML
* TACACS+
* Radius
* Azure Active Directory
* Google OAuth
* Generic OIDC
* Keycloak
* GitHub single sign-on
* GitHub
* GitHub Organization
* GitHub team
* GitHub enterprise
* GitHub enterprise organization
* GitHub enterprise team

Choose an authentication mechanism that adheres to your organization&#8217;s authentication policies.
The authentication mechanism used must ensure that the authentication-related traffic between Ansible Automation Platform and the authentication back-end is encrypted when the traffic occurs on a public or non-secure network (for example, LDAPS or LDAP over TLS, HTTPS for OAuth2 and SAML providers, etc.).

For more information on authentication methods, see Configuring an authetication type.

In the platform gateway, any “system administrator” account can edit, change, and update any inventory or automation definition.
Restrict these account privileges to the minimum set of users possible for low-level Ansible Automation Platform configuration and disaster recovery.
