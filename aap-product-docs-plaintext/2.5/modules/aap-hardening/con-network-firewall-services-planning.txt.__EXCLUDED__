When planning firewall or cloud network security group configurations related to Ansible Automation Platform, see the
"Network Ports" section of your chosen topology in Tested deployment models
to understand what network ports need to be opened on a firewall or security group.

For internet-connected systems, the Networks and Protocols section of Planning your installation defines the outgoing traffic requirements for services that Ansible Automation Platform can be configured to use, such as Red Hat automation hub, Insights for Ansible Automation Platform, Ansible Galaxy, the registry.redhat.io container image registry, and so on.

Restrict access to the ports used by the Ansible Automation Platform components to protected networks and clients. The following restrictions are highly recommended:

* Restrict the PostgreSQL database port (5432) on the database servers so that only the other Ansible Automation Platform component servers (automation controller, automation hub, Event-Driven Ansible controller) are permitted access.
* Restrict SSH access to the Ansible Automation Platform servers from the installation host and other trusted systems used for maintenance access to the Ansible Automation Platform servers.
* Restrict HTTPS access to the automation controller, automation hub, and Event-Driven Ansible controller from trusted networks and clients.
