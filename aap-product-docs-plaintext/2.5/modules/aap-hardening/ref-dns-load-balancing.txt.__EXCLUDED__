# DNS and load balancing

When using a load balancer with Ansible Automation Platform as described in the deployment topology, an additional FQDN is needed for the load-balancer.
For example, an FQDN such as aap.example.com might be used for the load balancer which in turn directs traffic to each of the platform gateway components defined in the installation inventory.
