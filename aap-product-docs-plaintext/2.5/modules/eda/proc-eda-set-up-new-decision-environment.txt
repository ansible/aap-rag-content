* You have pushed a decision environment image to an image repository or you chose to use the de-minimal image that is provided by de-supported options located in registry.redhat.io.

1. Log in to Ansible Automation Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Automation Decisions[Decision Environments].
3. Click btn:[Create decision environment].
4. Insert the following:
Name:: Insert the name.
Description:: This field is optional.
Organization:: Select an organization to associate with the decision environment.
Image:: This is the full image location, including the container registry, image name, and version tag.
Credential:: This field is optional. This is the credential needed to use the decision environment image.
5. Select btn:[Create decision environment].

Your decision environment is now created and can be managed on the Decision Environments page.
