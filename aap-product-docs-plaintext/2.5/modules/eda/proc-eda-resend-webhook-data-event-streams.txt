# Resending webhook data from your event stream type

After you have replaced your sources with the event stream you created, you can now resend data from the event stream to ensure that it is attached to your rulebook activation. In the example shared earlier, the GitHub event stream was used. The following example demonstrates how to resend webhook data if you were using a GitHub event stream.

1. Go back to the GitHub Webhook / Manage webhook page.
2. Click the Recent Deliveries tab.
3. Click the btn:[ellipsis].
4. Click btn:[Redeliver]. A Redeliver payload? window is displayed with a delivery message.
5. Click Yes, redeliver this payload.
6. Return to the Ansible Automation Platform to check your rule audit.
