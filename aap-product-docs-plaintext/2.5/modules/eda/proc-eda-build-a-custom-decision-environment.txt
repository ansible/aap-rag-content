# Building a custom decision environment for Event-Driven Ansible

Decision Environments are execution environments tailored towards running Ansible Rulebooks.

Similar to execution environments that run Ansible playbooks for automation controller, decision environments are designed to run rulebooks for Event-Driven Ansible controller.

You can create a custom decision environment for Event-Driven Ansible that provides a custom maintained or third-party event source plugin that is not available in the default decision environment.

* Ansible Automation Platform > = 2.5
* Event-Driven Ansible
* Ansible Builder > = 3.0

* Use de-minimal as the base image with Ansible Builder to build your custom decision environments.
This image is built from a base image provided by Red Hat at Ansible Automation Platform supported decision environment.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* Use the correct Event-Driven Ansible controller decision environment in Ansible Automation Platform to prevent rulebook activation failure.
* If you want to connect Event-Driven Ansible controller to Ansible Automation Platform 2.4, you must use registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-24/de-supported-rhel8:latest
* If you want to connect Event-Driven Ansible controller to Ansible Automation Platform 2.5, you must use registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/de-supported-rhel8:latest

The following is an example of the Ansible Builder definition file that uses de-minimal as a base image to build a custom decision environment with the ansible.eda collection:


```
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: 'registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/de-minimal-rhel8:latest'

dependencies:
  galaxy:
    collections:
      - ansible.eda
  python_interpreter:
    package_system: "python39"

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf
```


Additionally, if you need other Python packages or RPMs, you can add the following to a single definition file:


```
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: 'registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/de-minimal-rhel8:latest'

dependencies:
  galaxy:
    collections:
      - ansible.eda
  python:
    - six
    - psutil
  system:
    - iputils [platform:rpm]
  python_interpreter:
    package_system: "python39"

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf
```
