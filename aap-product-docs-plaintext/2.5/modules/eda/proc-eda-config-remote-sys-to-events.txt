# Configuring your remote system to send events

After you have created your event stream, you must configure your remote system to send events to Event-Driven Ansible controller. The method used for this configuration varies, depending on the vendor for the event stream credential type you select.

* The URL that was generated when you created your event stream
* Secrets or passwords that you set up in your event stream credential

The following example demonstrates how to configure webhooks in a remote system like GitHub to send events to Event-Driven Ansible controller. Each vendor will have unique methods for configuring your remote system to send events to Event-Driven Ansible controller.

1. Log in to your GitHub repository.
2. Click Your profile name â†’ Your repositories.


[NOTE]
----
If you do not have a repository, click New to create a new one, select an owner, add a Repository name, and click Create repository.
----

1. Navigate to Settings (tool bar).
2. In the General navigation pane, select Webhooks.
3. Click Add webhook.
4. In the Payload URL field, paste the URL you saved when you created your event stream.
5. Select application/json in the Content type list.
6. Enter your Secret.
7. Click Add webhook.

After the webhook has been added, it attempts to send a test payload to ensure there is connectivity between the two systems (GitHub and Event-Driven Ansible controller). If it can successfully send the data you will see a green check mark next to the Webhook URL with the message, Last delivery was successful.
