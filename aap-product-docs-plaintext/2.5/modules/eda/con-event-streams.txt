# Event streams

Event streams can send events from remote systems to Event-Driven Ansible controller. In a typical set-up, a server sends data to an event stream over the internet to an Event-Driven Ansible event stream receiver. When the data comes over the internet, the request must be authenticated. Depending on the webhook vendor or remote system, the authentication method could differ.

Event-Driven Ansible controller supports 7 different event stream types.



Event-Driven Ansible controller also supports 4 other specialized event streams that are based on the 7 basic event stream types:

* GitLab Event Stream
* GitHub Event Stream
* ServiceNow Event Stream
* Dynatrace Event Stream

These specialized types limit the parameters you use by adding default values. For example, the GitHub Event Stream is a specialization of the HMAC Event Stream with many of the fields already populated. After the GitHub Event Stream credential has been saved, the recommended defaults for the GitHub Event Stream are displayed.
