# Decision environments

Decision environments are a container image to run Ansible Rulebook rulebooks.
They create a common language for communicating automation dependencies, and give a standard way to build and distribute the automation environment.
You can find the default decision environment in the Ansible-Rulebook.
To create your own decision environment see Building a custom decision environment for Event-Driven Ansible within Ansible Automation Platform.

# Building a custom decision environment for Event-Driven Ansible

Decision Environments are execution environments tailored towards running Ansible Rulebooks.

Similar to execution environments that run Ansible rulebooks for automation controller, decision environments are designed to run rulebooks for Event-Driven Ansible controller.

You can create a custom decision environment for Event-Driven Ansible that provides a custom maintained or third-party event source plugin that is not available in the default decision environment.

* Ansible Automation Platform > = 2.5
* Event-Driven Ansible
* Ansible Builder > = 3.0

* Add the de-supported decision environment.
This image is built from a base image provided by Red Hat called de-minimal at Ansible Automation Platform supported decision environment.

[NOTE]
----
Red Hat recommends using de-minimal as the base image with Ansible Builder to build your custom decision environments.
----

The following is an example of the Ansible Builder definition file that uses de-minimal as a base image to build a custom decision environment with the ansible.eda collection:


```
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: 'registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-24/de-minimal-rhel8:latest'

dependencies:
  galaxy:
    collections:
      - ansible.eda
  python_interpreter:
    package_system: "python39"

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf
```


Additionally, if you need other Python packages or RPMs, you can add the following to a single definition file:


```
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: 'registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-24/de-minimal-rhel8:latest'

dependencies:
  galaxy:
    collections:
      - ansible.eda
  python:
    - six
    - psutil
  system:
    - iputils [platform:rpm]
  python_interpreter:
    package_system: "python39"

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf
```


# Setting up a new decision environment

The following steps describe how to import a decision environment into your Event-Driven Ansible controller Dashboard.

* You have set up a credential, if necessary.
For more information, see the Setting up credentials section.
* You have pushed a decision environment image to an image repository or you chose to use the image de-supported provided at registry.redhat.io.

1. Log in to Ansible Automation Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Automation Decisions[Decision Environments].
3. Click btn:[Create decision environment].
4. Insert the following:
Name:: Insert the name.
Description:: This field is optional.
Organization:: Select an organization to associate with the decision environment.
Image:: This is the full image location, including the container registry, image name, and version tag.
Credential:: This field is optional. This is the token needed to use the decision environment image.
5. Select btn:[Create decision environment].

Your decision environment is now created and can be managed on the Decision Environments page.

After saving the new decision environment, the decision environment&#8217;s details page is displayed.
From there or the Decision Environments list view, you can edit or delete it.
