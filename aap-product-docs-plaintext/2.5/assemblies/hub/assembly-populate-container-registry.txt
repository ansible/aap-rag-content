# Populating your private automation hub container registry

By default, private automation hub does not include automation execution environments.
To populate your container registry, you must push an execution environment to it.
You must follow a specific workflow to populate your private automation hub remote registry:
* Pull automation execution environments from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog (registry.redhat.io)
* Tag them
* Push them to your private automation hub remote registry

[IMPORTANT]
----
Image manifests and filesystem blobs were both originally served directly from registry.redhat.io and registry.access.redhat.com.
As of 1 May 2023, filesystem blobs are served from quay.io instead.
* Ensure that the Network ports and protocols listed in Table 6.4. Execution Environments (EE) are available to avoid problems pulling container images.
Make this change to any firewall configuration that specifically enables outbound connections to registry.redhat.io or registry.access.redhat.com.
Use the hostnames instead of IP addresses when configuring firewall rules.
After making this change you can continue to pull execution environments from registry.redhat.io and registry.access.redhat.com. You do not require a quay.io login, or need to interact with the quay.io registry directly in any way to continue pulling Red Hat container images.

# Pulling execution environments for use in automation hub

Before you can push execution environments to your private automation hub, you must first pull them from an existing registry and tag them for use. The following example details how to pull an execution environment from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog (registry.redhat.io).

* You have permissions to pull automation execution environments from registry.redhat.io.

1. Log in to Podman by using your registry.redhat.io credentials:

```
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
```

2. Enter your username and password.
3. Pull an execution environment:

```
$ podman pull registry.redhat.io/<ee_name>:<tag>
```


To verify that the execution environment you recently pulled is contained in the list, take these steps:

1. List the images in local storage:

```
$ podman images
```

2. Check the execution environment name, and verify that the tag is correct.

* See Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog Help for information on registering and getting execution environments.

# Tagging execution environments for use in automation hub

After you pull execution environments from a registry, tag them for use in your private automation hub remote registry.

* You have pulled an execution environment from an external registry.
* You have the FQDN or IP address of the automation hub instance.

* Tag a local execution environment with the automation hub container repository:

```
$ podman tag registry.redhat.io/<ee_name>:<tag> <automation_hub_hostname>/<ee_name>
```


1. List the images in local storage:

```
$ podman images
```

2. Verify that the execution environment you recently tagged with your automation hub information is contained in the list.

# Pushing an execution environment to private automation hub

You can push tagged execution environments to private automation hub to create new containers and populate the remote registry.

* You have permissions to create new containers.
* You have the FQDN or IP address of the automation hub instance.

1. Log in to Podman using your automation hub location and credentials:

```
$ podman login -u=<username> -p=<password> <automation_hub_url>
```


[WARNING]
----
Let Podman prompt you for your password when you log in. Entering your password at the same time as your username can expose your password to the shell history.
----
2. Push your execution environment to your automation hub remote registry:

```
$ podman push <automation_hub_url>/<ee_name>
```


The push operation re-compresses image layers during the upload, which is not guaranteed to be reproducible and is client-implementation dependent.
This may lead to image-layer digest changes and a failed push operation, resulting in Error: Copying this image requires changing layer representation, which is not possible (image is signed or the destination specifies a digest).

1. Log in to your Ansible Automation Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Automation Content[Execution Environments].
3. Locate the container in the container repository list.
