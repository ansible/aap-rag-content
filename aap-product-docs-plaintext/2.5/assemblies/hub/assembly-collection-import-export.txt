# Exporting and importing collections in automation hub

Ansible automation hub stores automation content collections within repositories. These collections are versioned by the automation content creator. Many versions of the same collection can exist in the same or different repositories at the same time.
Collections are stored as .tar files that can be imported and exported. This storage format ensures that the collection you are importing to a new repository is the same one that was originally created and exported.

After collections are finalized, you can import them to a location where they can be distributed to others across your organization.

2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Collections]. The Collections page displays all collections across all repositories. You can search for a specific collection.

# Importing an automation content collection in automation hub

As an automation content creator, you can import a collection to use in a custom repository. To use a collection in your custom repository, you must first import the collection into your namespace so the automation hub administrator can approve it.

1. Log in to Ansible Automation Platform.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Namespaces]. The Namespaces page displays all of the namespaces available.
3. Select the namespace to which you want to add your collection.
4. Select the Collections tab.
5. Click btn:[Upload Collection].
6. Enter or browse to select a collection file.
7. Select the repository pipeline to add the collection. The choices are Staging repos and Repositories without pipeline.
8. Click btn:[Upload collection].

The Imports screen displays a summary of tests and notifies you if the collection upload is successful or has failed. To find your imports, on your namespace click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942; and select Imports.

[NOTE]

If the collection is not approved, it is not displayed in the published repository.
