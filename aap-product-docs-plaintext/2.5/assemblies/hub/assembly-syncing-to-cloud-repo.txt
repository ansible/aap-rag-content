# Configuring Ansible automation hub remote repositories to synchronize content

Use remote configurations to configure your private automation hub to synchronize with Ansible Certified Content Collections hosted on console.redhat.com or with your collections in Ansible Galaxy.

[IMPORTANT]
----
To synchronize content, you can now upload a manually-created requirements file from the rh-certified remote. Remotes are configurations that allow you to synchronize content to your custom repositories from an external collection source.
As of the 2.4 release you can still synchronize content, but synclists are deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.
----
Each remote configuration located in menu:Automation Content[Remotes] provides information for both the community and rh-certified repository about when the repository was last updated.
You can add new content to Ansible automation hub at any time using the Edit and Sync features included on the menu:Automation Content[Repositories] page.
## What's the difference between Ansible Galaxy and Ansible automation hub?
Collections published to Ansible Galaxy are the latest content published by the Ansible community and have no joint support claims associated with them.
Ansible Galaxy is the recommended frontend directory for the Ansible community to access content.
Collections published to Ansible automation hub are targeted to joint customers of Red Hat and selected partners.
Customers need an Ansible subscription to access and download collections on Ansible automation hub.
A certified collection means that Red Hat and partners have a strategic relationship in place and are ready to support joint customers, and that the collections may have had additional testing and validation done against them.
## How do I request a namespace on Ansible Galaxy?
To request a namespace through an Ansible Galaxy GitHub issue, follow these steps:
* Send an email to ansiblepartners@redhat.com
* Include the GitHub username used to sign up on Ansible Galaxy.
You must have logged in at least once for the system to validate.
After users are added as administrators of the namespace, you can use the self-serve process to add more administrators.
## Are there any restrictions for Ansible Galaxy namespace naming?
Collection namespaces must follow Python module name convention.
This means collections should have short, all lowercase names.
You can use underscores in the collection name if it improves readability.

# Token management in automation hub

Before you can interact with automation hub by uploading or downloading collections, you must create an API token. The automation hub API token authenticates your ansible-galaxy client to the Red Hat automation hub server.

Your method for creating the API token differs according to the type of automation hub that you are using:

* Automation hub uses offline token management. See Creating the offline token in automation hub.
* Private automation hub uses API token management. See Creating the API token in private automation hub.
* If you are using Keycloak to authenticate your private automation hub, follow the procedure for Creating the offline token in automation hub.

## Creating the offline token in automation hub

In automation hub, you can create an offline token by using Token management. The offline token is a secret token used to protect your content.

1. Navigate to Ansible Automation Platform on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Hub[Connect to Hub].
3. Under Offline token, click btn:[Load Token].
4. Click the btn:[Copy to clipboard] icon to copy the offline token.
5. Paste the API token into a file and store in a secure location.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The offline token is a secret token used to protect your content. Store your token in a secure location.
----

The offline token is now available for configuring automation hub as your default collections server or for uploading collections by using the ansible-galaxy command line tool.


[NOTE]
----
Your offline token expires after 30 days of inactivity. For more on obtaining a new offline token, see Keeping your offline token active.
----

## Creating the API token in private automation hub

In private automation hub, you can create an API token using API token management. The API token is a secret token used to protect your content.

* Valid subscription credentials for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

1. Log in to your private automation hub.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[API token].
3. Click btn:[Load Token].
4. To copy the API token, click the btn:[Copy to clipboard] icon.
5. Paste the API token into a file and store in a secure location.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The API token is a secret token used to protect your content. Store your API token in a secure location.
----

The API token is now available for configuring automation hub as your default collections server or uploading collections using the ansible-galaxy command line tool.


[NOTE]
----
The API token does not expire.
----

## Keeping your offline token active

Offline tokens expire after 30 days of inactivity. You can keep your offline token from expiring by periodically refreshing your offline token.

Keeping an online token active is useful when an application performs an action on behalf of the user; for example, this allows the application to perform a routine data backup when the user is offline.


[NOTE]
----
If your offline token expires, you must obtain a new one.
----

* Run the following command to prevent your token from expiring:

```
curl https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token -d grant_type=refresh_token -d client_id="cloud-services" -d refresh_token="{{ user_token }}" --fail --silent --show-error --output /dev/null
```


# Configuring the rh-certified remote repository and synchronizing Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collection

You can edit the rh-certified remote repository to synchronize collections from automation hub hosted on console.redhat.com to your private automation hub.
By default, your private automation hub rh-certified repository includes the URL for the entire group of Ansible Certified Content Collections.

To use only those collections specified by your organization, a private automation hub administrator can upload manually-created requirements files from the rh-certified remote.

If you have collections A, B, and C in your requirements file, and a new collection X is added to console.redhat.com that you want to use, you must add X to your requirements file for private automation hub to synchronize it.

* You have valid Modify Ansible repo content permissions.
For more information on permissions, see Access management and authentication.
* You have retrieved the Sync URL and API Token from the automation hub hosted service on console.redhat.com.
* You have configured access to port 443. This is required for synchronizing certified collections. For more information, see the automation hub table in the Network ports and protocols chapter of Planning your installation.

1. Log in to your Ansible Automation Platform.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Remotes].
3. In the rh-certified remote repository, click btn:[Edit remote].

# Creating a requirements file

Use a requirements file to add collections to your automation hub. Requirements files are in YAML format and list the collections that you want to install in your automation hub. After you create your requirements.yml file listing the collections you want to install, you will then run the install command to add the collections to your hub instance.

A standard requirements.yml file contains the following parameters:

* name: the name of the collection formatted as <namespace>.<collection_name>
* version: the collection version number

1. Create your requirements file.

In YAML format, collection information in your requirements file should look like this:

```bash
collections:
 name: namespace.collection_name
 version: 1.0.0
```

2. After you have created your requirements file listing information for each collection that you want to install, navigate to the directory where the file is located and run the following command:


```bash
$ ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```


## Installing an individual collection from the command line

To install an individual collection to your automation hub, run the following command:


```bash
$ ansible-galaxy collection install namespace.collection_name
```
