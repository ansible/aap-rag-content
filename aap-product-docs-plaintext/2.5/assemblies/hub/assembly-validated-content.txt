# Ansible validated content

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform includes Ansible validated content, which complements existing Red Hat Ansible Certified Content.
Ansible validated content provides an expert-led path for performing operational tasks on a variety of platforms from both Red Hat and our trusted partners.

# Configuring validated collections with the installer

When you download and run the RPM bundle installer, certified and validated collections are automatically uploaded.
Certified collections are uploaded into the rh-certified repository.
Validated collections are uploaded into the validated repository.

You can change the default configuration by using two variables:

* automationhub_seed_collections is a boolean that defines whether or not preloading is enabled.
* automationhub_collection_seed_repository`is a variable that enables you to specify the type of content to upload when it is set to `true.
Possible values are certified or validated.
If this variable is missing, both content sets will be uploaded.


[NOTE]
----
Changing the default configuration may require further platform configuration changes for other content you may use.
