# Red Hat Certified, validated, and Ansible Galaxy content in automation hub

Ansible Certified Content Collections are included in your subscription to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. Using Ansible automation hub, you can access and curate a unique set of collections from all forms of Ansible content.

Red Hat Ansible content contains two types of content:

* Ansible Certified Content Collections
* Ansible validated content collections

You can use both Ansible Certified Content Collections or Ansible validated content collections to build your automation library. For more information on the differences between Ansible Certified Content Collections and Ansible validated content collections, see the Knowledgebase article Ansible Certified Content Collections and Ansible validated content, or Ansible validated content in this guide.

You can update these collections manually by downloading their packages.

You can use Ansible automation hub to distribute the relevant Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collections to your users by creating a requirements file or a synclist. Use a requirements file to install collections to your automation hub, as synclists can only be managed by users with platform administrator privileges.

Before you can use a requirements file to install content, you must:

1. Obtain an automation hub API token
2. Use the API token to configure a remote repository in your local hub
3. Then, Create a requirements file.
