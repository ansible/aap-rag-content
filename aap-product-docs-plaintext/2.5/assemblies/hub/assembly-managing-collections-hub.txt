# Managing collections in automation hub

As a content creator, you can use namespaces in automation hub to curate and manage collections. For example, you can:

* Create teams with permissions to curate namespaces and upload collections to private automation hub
* Add information and resources to the namespace to help end users of the collection in their automation tasks
* Upload collections to the namespace
* Review the namespace import logs to determine the success or failure of uploading the collection and its current approval status
