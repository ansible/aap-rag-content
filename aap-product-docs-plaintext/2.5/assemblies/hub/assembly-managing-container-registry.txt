# Container registries

The automation hub remote registry is used for storing and managing execution environments.
When you have built or sourced an execution environment, you can push that execution environment to the registry portion of private automation hub to create a container repository.

* Push an execution environment to the automation hub remote registry.
* Create a group with access to the container repository in the registry.
* Add the new group to the container repository.
* Add a README to the container repository to provide users with information and relevant links.
