# Developing collections

Collections are a distribution format for Ansible content that can include playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins.
Red Hat provides Ansible Content Collections on Ansible automation hub that contain both Red Hat Ansible Certified Content and Ansible validated content.

If you have installed private automation hub, you can create collections for your organization and push them
to private automation hub so that you can use them in job templates in Ansible Automation Platform.
You can use collections to package and distribute plug-ins. These plug-ins are written in Python.

You can also create collections to package and distribute Ansible roles, which are expressed in YAML.
You can also include playbooks and custom plug-ins that are required for these roles in the collection.
Typically, collections of roles are distributed for use within your organization.
