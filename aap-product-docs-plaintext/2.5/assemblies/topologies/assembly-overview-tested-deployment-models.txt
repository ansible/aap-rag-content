# Overview of tested deployment models

Red Hat tests Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 with a defined set of topologies to give you opinionated deployment options. Deploy all components of Ansible Automation Platform so that all features and capabilities are available for use without the need to take further action.
Red Hat tests the installation of Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 based on a defined set of infrastructure topologies or reference architectures. Enterprise organizations can use one of the enterprise topologies for production deployments to ensure the highest level of uptime, performance, and continued scalability. Organizations or deployments that are resource constrained can use a "growth" topology.
It is possible to install the Ansible Automation Platform on different infrastructure topologies and with different environment configurations. Red Hat does not fully test topologies outside of published reference architectures. Use a tested topology for all new deployments.
