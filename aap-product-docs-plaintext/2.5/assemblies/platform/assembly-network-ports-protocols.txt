# Network ports and protocols

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform server in order for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.

The following architectural diagram is an example of a fully deployed Ansible Automation Platform with all possible components.


[NOTE]
----
In some of the following use cases, hop nodes are used instead of a direct link from an execution node. Hop nodes are an option for connecting control and execution nodes. Hop nodes use minimal CPU and memory, so vertically scaling hop nodes does not impact system capacity.

The following table indicates the destination port and the direction of network traffic:

The following default destination ports and installer inventory listed are configurable. If you choose to configure them to suit your environment, you might experience a change in behavior.

* Hybrid nodes act as a combination of control and execution nodes, and therefore Hybrid nodes share the connections of both.
* If receptor_listener_port is defined, the machine also requires an available open port on which to establish inbound TCP connections, for example, 27199.
* It might be the case that some servers do not listen on receptor port (the default is 27199)

Suppose you have a  Control plane with nodes A, B, C, D

The RPM installer creates a strongly connected peering between the control plane nodes with a least privileged approach and opens the tcp listener only on those nodes where it is required. All the receptor connections are bidirectional, so once the connection is created, the receptor can communicate in both directions.

The following is an example peering set up for three controller nodes:

Controller node A --> Controller node B

Controller node A --> Controller node C

Controller node B --> Controller node C

You can force the listener by setting

receptor_listener=True

However, a connection Controller B --> A is likely to be rejected as that connection already exists.

This means that nothing connects to Controller A as Controller A is creating the connections to the other nodes, and the following command does not return anything on Controller A:

[root@controller1 ~]# ss -ntlp | grep 27199 [root@controller1 ~]#

[IMPORTANT]
----
Image manifests and filesystem blobs are served directly from registry.redhat.io.
However, from 1 May 2023, filesystem blobs are served from quay.io instead.
To avoid problems pulling container images, you must enable outbound connections to the listed quay.io hostnames.
This change should be made to any firewall configuration that specifically enables outbound connections to registry.redhat.io.
Use the hostnames instead of IP addresses when configuring firewall rules.
After making this change, you can continue to pull images from registry.redhat.io.
You do not require a quay.io login, or need to interact with the quay.io registry directly in any way to continue pulling Red Hat container images.
For more information, see Firewall changes for container image pulls.
