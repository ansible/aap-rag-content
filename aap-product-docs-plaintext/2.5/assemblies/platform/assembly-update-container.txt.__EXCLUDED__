# Container-based Ansible Automation Platform

To update your container-based Ansible Automation Platform, start by reviewing the update considerations. You can then download the latest version of the Ansible Automation Platform installer, configure the inventory file in the installation bundle to reflect your environment, and then run the installer.

# Updating container-based Ansible Automation Platform

Perform a patch update for a container-based installation of Ansible Automation Platform from 2.5 to 2.5.x.

You have done the following:

* Reviewed the release notes for the associated patch release. For more information, see the Ansible Automation Platform Release notes.
* Created a backup of your Ansible Automation Platform deployment. For more information, see Backing up controller-based Ansible Automation Platform.

1. Download the latest version of the containerized installer from the Ansible Automation Platform download.
1. For online installations Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 Containerized Setup
2. For offline or bundled installations: Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 Containerized Setup Bundle
2. Copy the installer .tar file onto your Red Hat Enterprise Linux host.
3. Decide where you want the installer to reside on the filesystem. Installation related files will be created under this location and require at least 10 GB for the initial installation.
4. Unpack the installer .tar file into your installation directory, and go to the unpacked directory.
1. To unpack the online installer:

```
$ tar xfvz ansible-automation-platform-containerized-setup-<version>.tar.gz
```

2. To unpack the offline or bundled installer:

```
$ tar xfvz ansible-automation-platform-containerized-setup-bundle-<version>-<arch name>.tar.gz
```

5. Edit the inventory file so that it matches your required configuration. You can keep the same parameters from your existing Ansible Automation Platform deployment or you can change the parameters to match any modifications to your environment.
6. Run the install command:

```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible.containerized_installer.install
```

* If your privilege escalation requires a password to be entered, append -K to the command. You will then be prompted for the BECOME password.
* You can use increasing verbosity, up to 4 vâ€™s (-vvvv) to see the details of the installation process. However it is important to note that this can significantly increase installation time, so it is recommended that you use it only as needed or requested by Red Hat support.

The installation will begin.

# Backing up container-based Ansible Automation Platform

Perform a back up of your container-based installation of Ansible Automation Platform.

1. Go to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installation directory on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux host.
2. Run the backup.yml playbook:

```
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible.containerized_installer.backup
```


This will backup the important data deployed by the containerized installer such as:
* PostgreSQL databases
* Configuration files
* Data files

By default, the backup directory is set to ~/backups. You can change this by using the backup_dir variable in your inventory file.
