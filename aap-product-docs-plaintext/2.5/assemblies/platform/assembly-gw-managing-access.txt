# Managing access with role based access control

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts user access based on their role within an organization to which they are assigned in Ansible Automation Platform. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that users have to the Ansible Automation Platform components and resources.
You can control what users can do with the components of Ansible Automation Platform at a broad or granular level depending on your RBAC policy. You can designate whether the user is a system administrator or normal user and align roles and access permissions with their positions within the organization.
Roles can be defined with multiple permissions that can then be assigned to resources, teams and users. The permissions that make up a role dictate what the assigned role allows. Permissions are allocated with only the access needed for a user to perform the tasks appropriate for their role.

# Organizations

An organization is a logical collection of users, teams, and resources. It is the highest level object in the Ansible Automation Platform object hierarchy. After you have created an organization, Ansible Automation Platform displays the organization details. You can then manage access and execution environments for the organization.
Ansible Automation Platform automatically creates a default organization and the system administrator is automatically assigned to this organization. If you have a Self-support level license, you have only the default organization available and must not delete it.

## Organizations list view

The Organizations page displays the existing organizations for your installation. From here, you can search for a specific organization, filter the list of organizations, or change the sort order for the list.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:menu:Access Management[Organizations].
2. In the Search bar, enter an appropriate keyword for the organization you want to search for and click the arrow icon.
3. From the menu bar, you can sort the list of organizations by using the arrows for Name to toggle your sorting preference.

# Teams

A team is a subdivision of an organization with associated users, and resources. Teams provide a means to implement role-based access control schemes and delegate responsibilities across organizations. For instance, you can grant permissions to a Team rather than each user on the team.

You can create as many teams as needed for your organization. Teams can only be assigned to one organization while an organization can be made up of multiple teams. Each team can be assigned roles, the same way roles are assigned for users. Teams can also scalably assign ownership for credentials, preventing multiple interface click-throughs to assign the same credentials to the same user.

You can sort or search the User list by Username, First name, Last name, or Email. Click the arrows in the header to toggle your sorting preference.
You can view User type and Email beside the user name on the Users page.

## Users list view

The Users page displays the existing users for your installation. From here, you can search for a specific user, filter the list of users, or change the sort order for the list.

When user accounts have been migrated to Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 during the upgrade process, these accounts are also displayed in the Users list view. Users previously designated as automation controller or automation hub administrators are labeled as Normal in the User type column. You can see whether these users have administrator privileges, by editing the account. See Editing a user for instructions.

## Creating a user

There are three types of users in Ansible Automation Platform:

Normal user:: Normal users have read and write access limited to the resources (such as inventory, projects, and job templates) for which that user has been granted the appropriate roles and privileges. Normal users are the default type of user when no other User type is specified.
Ansible Automation Platform Administrator:: An administrator (also known as a Superuser) has full system administration privileges — with full read and write privileges over the entire installation. An administrator is typically responsible for managing all aspects of and delegating responsibilities for day-to-day work to various users.
Ansible Automation Platform Auditor:: Auditors have read-only capability for all objects within the environment.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Users].
2. Click btn:[Create user].
3. Enter the details about your new user in the fields on the Create user page. Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required.

## Editing a user

You can modify the properties of a user account after it is created.

In upgrade scenarios, there might be pre-existing user accounts from automation controller or automation hub services. When editing these user accounts, the User type checkboxes indicate whether the account had service level administrator privileges. You can revoke or assign administrator permissions for the individual services and designate the user as either an Ansible Automation Platform Administrator, Ansible Automation Platform Auditor or normal user. Assigning administrator privileges to all of the individual services automatically designates the user as an Ansible Automation Platform Administrator. See Creating a user for more information about user types.

To see whether a user had service level auditor privileges, you must refer to the API.


[NOTE]
----
Users previously designated as automation controller or automation hub administrators are labeled as Normal in the User type column in the Users list view. You can see whether these users have administrator privileges, from the Edit Users page.
