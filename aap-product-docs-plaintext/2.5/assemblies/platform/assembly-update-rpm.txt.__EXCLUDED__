# RPM-based Ansible Automation Platform

To update your RPM-based Ansible Automation Platform, start by reviewing the update considerations. You can then download the latest version of the Ansible Automation Platform installer, configure the inventory file in the installation bundle to reflect your environment, and then run the installer.

# Update planning

Before you begin the update process, review the following considerations to plan and prepare your Ansible Automation Platform deployment:

* Even if you have a valid license from an earlier version, you must give your credentials or a subscription manifest upon upgrading to the latest version of Ansible Automation Platform. For more information, see Attaching your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription in Access management and authentication.
* Clustered upgrades require special attention to instance and instance groups before upgrading. Ensure you capture your inventory or instance group details before upgrading. For more information, see Clustering in Configuring automation execution.
* If you are currently running Event-Driven Ansible controller, disable all rulebook activations before upgrading to ensure that only new activations run after the upgrade process has completed. This prevents possibilities of orphaned containers running activations from the earlier version. For more information, see Enabling and disabling rulebook activations in Using automation decisions.

# Choosing and obtaining a Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installer

Choose the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installer you need based on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux environment internet connectivity. Review the following scenarios to decide which Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installer meets your needs.

## Installing with internet access

Choose the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installer if your Red Hat Enterprise Linux environment is connected to the internet. Installing with internet access retrieves the latest required repositories, packages, and dependencies. Choose one of the following ways to set up your Ansible Automation Platform installer.

1. Navigate to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform download page.
2. Click btn:[Download Now] for the Ansible Automation Platform <latest-version> Setup.
3. Transfer the file to the target server using scp or curl:
1. Using scp:
1. Run the following command, replacing private_key.pem, user, and server_ip with your appropriate values:


```
$ scp -i private_key.pem aap-bundled-installer.tar.gz user@server_ip:
```


1. Using curl:
1. If the setup file URL is available, you can download it directly to the target server using curl. Replace <download_url> with the file URL:


```
$ curl -0 <download_url>
```



[NOTE]
----
If the file needs to be extracted after downloading, run the following command:

```
$ tar xvzf aap-bundled-installer.tar.gz
```

----

1. Install Ansible Automation Platform Installer Package

v.2.5 for RHEL 8 for x86_64

```
$ sudo dnf install --enablerepo=ansible-automation-platform-2.5-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms ansible-automation-platform-installer
```


v.2.5 for RHEL 9 for x86_64

```
$ sudo dnf install --enablerepo=ansible-automation-platform-2.5-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms ansible-automation-platform-installer
```



[NOTE]
----
dnf install enables the repo as the repo is disabled by default.
----

When you use the RPM installer, the files are placed under the /opt/ansible-automation-platform/installer directory.

## Installing without internet access

Use the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Bundle installer if you are unable to access the internet, or would prefer not to install separate components and dependencies from online repositories. Access to Red Hat Enterprise Linux repositories is still needed. All other dependencies are included in the tar archive.

1. Go to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform download page.
2. Click btn:[Download Now] for the Ansible Automation Platform <latest-version> Setup Bundle.
3. Extract the files:

```
$ tar xvzf ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-<latest-version>.tar.gz
```


# Backing up RPM-based Ansible Automation Platform

Back up an existing Ansible Automation Platform instance by running the setup.sh script with the backup_dir flag, which saves the content and configuration of your current environment:

1. Go to your Ansible Automation Platform installation directory.
2. Run the setup.sh script following the example below:

```
$ ./setup.sh -e 'backup_dir=/ansible/mybackup' -e 'use_compression=True' @credentials.yml -b
```

* backup_dir specifies a directory to save your backup to.
* @credentials.yml passes the password variables and their values that are encrypted by ansible-vault.

With a successful backup, a backup file is created at /ansible/mybackup/<platform_installation_directory_name>.tar.gz.

Additional resources

* For more information about backing up and restoring, see Backup and restore in Configuring automation execution.

# Setting up the inventory file

Before upgrading your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installation, edit the inventory file so that it matches your desired configuration. You can keep the same parameters from your existing Ansible Automation Platform deployment or you can modify the parameters to match any changes to your environment.

1. Navigate to the installation program directory.

Bundled installer

```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-<version_number>-<arch_version>
```


Online installer

```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-<version_number>
```

2. Update the inventory file to match your desired configuration. You can use the same inventory file from an existing Ansible Automation Platform installation if there are no changes to the environment.


[NOTE]
----
Provide a reachable IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for all hosts to ensure that users can synchronize and install content from Ansible automation hub from a different node. Do not use localhost. If localhost is used, the upgrade will be stopped as part of preflight checks.
----

# Running the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installer setup script

You can run the setup script once you have finished updating the inventory file.

* Run the setup.sh script:

```
$ ./setup.sh
```


The installation will begin.
