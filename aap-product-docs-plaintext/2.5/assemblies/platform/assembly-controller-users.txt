# Users

Users associated with an organization are shown in the Users tab of the organization.
You can add other users to an organization, including a normal user or system administrator, but first, you must create them.

[NOTE]
----
Ansible Automation Platform automatically creates a default admin user so they can log in and set up Ansible Automation Platform for their organization. This user can not be deleted or modified.
----
You can sort or search the User list by Username, First name, Last name, or Email. Click the arrows in the header to toggle your sorting preference.
You can view User type and Email beside the user name on the Users page.

# Users list view

The Users page displays the existing users for your installation. From here, you can search for a specific user, filter the list of users, or change the sort order for the list.

When user accounts have been migrated to Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 during the upgrade process, these accounts are also displayed in the Users list view. Users previously designated as automation controller or automation hub administrators are labeled as Normal in the User type column. You can see whether these users have administrator privileges, by editing the account. See Editing a user for instructions.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Users].
2. In the Search bar, enter an appropriate keyword for the user you want to search for and click the arrow icon.
3. From the menu bar, you can sort the list of users by using the arrows for  Username, Email, First name, Last name or Last login to toggle your sorting preference.
4. You can view user details by selecting a Username from the Users list view.

# Creating a user

There are three types of users in Ansible Automation Platform:

Normal user:: Normal users have read and write access limited to the resources (such as inventory, projects, and job templates) for which that user has been granted the appropriate roles and privileges. Normal users are the default type of user when no other User type is specified.
Ansible Automation Platform Administrator:: An administrator (also known as a Superuser) has full system administration privileges — with full read and write privileges over the entire installation. An administrator is typically responsible for managing all aspects of and delegating responsibilities for day-to-day work to various users.
Ansible Automation Platform Auditor:: Auditors have read-only capability for all objects within the environment.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Users].
2. Click btn:[Create user].
3. Enter the details about your new user in the fields on the Create user page. Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required.
4. Normal users are the default when no User type is specified. To define a user as an administrator or auditor, select a User type checkbox.

[NOTE]
----
If you are modifying your own password, log out and log back in again for it to take effect.
----
5. Select the Organization to be assigned for this user. For information about creating a new organization, refer to Creating an organization.
6. Click btn:[Create user].

When the user is successfully created, the User dialog opens. From here, you can review and modify the user’s Teams, Roles, Tokens and other membership details.


[NOTE]
----
If the user is not newly-created, the details screen displays the last login activity of that user.
----

If you log in as yourself, and view the details of your user profile, you can manage tokens from your user profile by selecting the Tokens tab For more information, see Adding a token.

# Editing a user

You can modify the properties of a user account after it is created.

In upgrade scenarios, there might be pre-existing user accounts from automation controller or automation hub services. When editing these user accounts, the User type checkboxes indicate whether the account had service level administrator privileges. You can revoke or assign administrator permissions for the individual services and designate the user as either an Ansible Automation Platform Administrator, Ansible Automation Platform Auditor or normal user. Assigning administrator privileges to all of the individual services automatically designates the user as an Ansible Automation Platform Administrator. See Creating a user for more information about user types.

To see whether a user had service level auditor privileges, you must refer to the API.


[NOTE]
----
Users previously designated as automation controller or automation hub administrators are labeled as Normal in the User type column in the Users list view. You can see whether these users have administrator privileges, from the Edit Users page.
----

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Users].
2. Select the check box for the user that you want to modify.
3. Click the Pencil icon and select Edit user.

[NOTE]
----
If the user account was migrated to Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 during the upgrade process and had administrator privileges for an individual service, additional User type checkboxes will be available. You can use these checkboxes to revoke or add individual privileges or designate the user as a platform administrator, system auditor or normal user.
----
5. After your changes are complete, click Save user.

# Deleting a user
