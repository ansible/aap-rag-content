# Documentation style

## Authoring modularly structured documentation

the documentation follows a modular-based content model, providing a structure for writing and presenting user-story-based documentation. User-story-based documentation attempts to address the reader&#8217;s needs more than focusing on feature-based documentation. This is accomplished using a set of templates for concepts, references, procedures and assemblies. Templates can be found here.

## Red Hat Documentation Asciidoc Mark-up Conventions

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform documentation is written in Asciidoc. See Red Hat Documentation Asciidoc Mark-up Conventions to learn more about implementing Asciidoc in your writing.

## Red Hat product documentation style conventions

The Red Hat Customer Content Services team uses the Red Hat supplementary style guide for product documentation and The IBM Style Guide as its primary sources for technical writing conventions and style guidelines. Refer first to the Red Hat supplementary style guide for product documentation for style guidance and conventions. If a topic is not included there, it means we follow the convention as established in the IBM Style Guide.
