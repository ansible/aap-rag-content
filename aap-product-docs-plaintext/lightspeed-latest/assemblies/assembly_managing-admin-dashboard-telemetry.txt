# Viewing and managing Admin dashboard telemetry

Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed collects the following telemetry data by default:
* Operational telemetry data

This is the data that is required to operate and troubleshoot the Ansible Lightspeed service. For more information, refer the Enterprise Agreement. You cannot disable the collection of operational telemetry data.

This includes the following data:
* Organization you are logged into (Organization ID, account number)
* Large language model (or models) that you are connected to
* Admin dashboard telemetry data

This is the data that provides insight into how your organization users are using the Ansible Lightspeed service, and the metrics are displayed on the Admin dashboard.

This includes the following data:
* Prompts and content suggestions, including accept or reject of the content suggestions
* User sentiment feedback

You can also disable the Admin dashboard telemetry if you no longer want to collect and monitor the telemetry data.

# Disabling the Admin dashboard telemetry

Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed collects the Admin dashboard telemetry data by default. The data provides insight into how your organization users are using the Ansible Lightspeed service. If you no longer want to collect analytics telemetry data for your organization, you can disable the Admin dashboard telemetry.

The earlier telemetry data is still available on the Admin dashboard, but no latest data is displayed. If you re-enable the Admin dashboard telemetry, the Ansible Lightspeed service starts collecting data for your organization, and the metrics are displayed on the Admin dashboard after 24 hours.

* You have organization administrator privileges to a Red Hat Customer Portal organization with a valid Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform  subscription.

1. Log in to the Ansible Lightspeed portal as an organization administrator.
2. From the login screen, click Admin Portal.
3. Under Admin Portal, click Telemetry.
