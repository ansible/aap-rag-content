# Assigning and removing seat licenses

After connecting Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed to an IBM watsonx Code Assistant instance, Red Hat Customer Portal organization administrators can assign seat licenses to users in their organization. The seat assignment feature enables select Ansible users in your organization to access and use Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed.
Your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription includes a specific number of Ansible Lightspeed named seats depending on the number of Ansible Automation Platform subscriptions your organization has purchased. Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed authenticates users by using Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) and verifies that they have an assigned seat license.

# Assigning seat licenses

You can grant Ansible Lightspeed seat licenses to select users in your organization.

* You must be assigned as an organization administrator in the Red Hat Customer Portal.
* You have configured Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed to connect to IBM watsonx Code Assistant instance.

1. Go to Ansible Automation Platform on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant[Seat Management].
3. Click Assign users.
4. Specify the usernames of users that you want to assign a seat license to.
5. Click Assign, and on the verification message, click Ok to confirm.

# Removing seat licenses

You can remove users who no longer need to access Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed, which makes licenses available for others to use. When you remove a user, the Ansible user&#8217;s Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed seat license only is removed; it does not remove the user from your Red Hat Customer Portal organization.


[IMPORTANT]
----
To prevent deactivated RH-SSO users from accessing Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed, you must remove their Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed seat licenses. When RH-SSO users are deactivated, their Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed seat licenses are not removed automatically. These users can continue accessing Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed until the next time they are forced to reauthenticate with RH-SSO. Removing the users' seat licenses revokes their access to Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed immediately.
