# Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant Release Notes

# Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties.
We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist.
Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases.
For more details, see our CTO Chris Wright's message.

The dashboard displays a list of your repositories where the code bot is installed, the status of your repository scans, and indicates whether the scan schedule is not set, or is set to manual or scheduled scan. From the dashboard, you can start a manual scan, view the scan history, and view the repository. For more information, see Installing and configuring the Ansible code bot.
* Ability to collect and manage the Admin dashboard telemetry

Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed now collects Admin dashboard telemetry data that provides insight into how your organization users are using the Ansible Lightspeed service, and displays the metrics on the Admin dashboard.
