# New features and enhancements

* Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment

Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed is now available for on-premise deployments. This capability provides the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform customers more control over their data and supports compliance with enterprise security policies. For example, organizations in sensitive industries with data privacy or air-gapped requirements can use on-premise deployments of both Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed and IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on Cloud Pak for Data. Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployments are supported on Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform version 2.4. For more information, see Setting up Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment.

[NOTE]
----
The following capabilities are not yet available on Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployments:
* Viewing telemetry data on the Admin dashboard
* Generating playbooks and viewing playbook explanations
----
* Playbook generation and explanations

Using the Ansible VS Code extension, you can create Ansible playbooks using a natural language interface in English. Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant reads the natural language prompts and generates an entire playbook recommendation based on your intent. You can also view the explanations for new or existing playbooks. The playbook explanations describe what the playbook or task within the playbook does and contextualize its impact.
