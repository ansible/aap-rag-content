* Single tasks and multitask generation

Using natural language prompts, you can generate single task or multiple task recommendations for Ansible task files and playbooks.
* Content source matching

For each generated code recommendation, Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed lists content source matches, including details such as potential source, content author, and relevant licenses. You can use this data to gain insight into potential training data sources used to generate the code recommendations.
* Post-processing capabilities

Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed offers post-processing capabilities that augment IBM watsonx Code Assistant and improve the quality and accuracy of code recommendations.
* Content modernization

The Ansible code bot scans existing content collections, roles, and playbooks through Git repositories, and proactively creates pull requests whenever best practices or quality improvement recommendations are available. The bot automatically submits pull requests to the repository, which proactively alerts the repository owner to a recommended change to their content. Ansible code bot is available as a Technical Preview.
