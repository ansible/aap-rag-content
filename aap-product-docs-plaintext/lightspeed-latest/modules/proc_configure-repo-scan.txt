# Configuring the Ansible code bot to scan your repository at regular intervals

After installing the Ansible code bot, it automatically scans the selected repositories that are in Jinja format. Once the scanning is complete, the code bot generates an initial PR for each repository; the initial PR also contains the scan schedule configured to run weekly. You must review the initial PR for the suggested changes and merge the PR. Once the initial PR is merged, the scan schedule is triggered, and the subsequent repository scans are performed weekly. If required, you can change the scan schedule to a daily or monthly cadence.


[NOTE]
----
If you do not merge the initial PR, the weekly scan schedule is not triggered and the Ansible code bot dashboard displays the repositories without any associated scan history.  In such a scenario, you must manually create a configuration file ansible-code-bot.yml and specify your scan schedule within the file.
----

You can specify one of following interval cadence to scan your Git repositories:

* Daily: Runs every day from Monday to Sunday.
* Weekly: Runs once a week on Monday. Per the initial configuration PR, the Ansible code bot is set to scan your repositories weekly until you change the schedule to daily or monthly.
* Monthly: Runs on the first day of the month, once each month.

For each interval cadence, Ansible code bot starts scanning your Git repositories at 9 AM UTC.

1. In GitHub, navigate to the repository that you want to scan.
2. Create a .yml configuration file named ansible-code-bot.yml in your repository .github folder.
For example, .github/ansible-code-bot.yml.
3. In the configuration file, specify the scan schedule in the interval parameter. You can specify the interval parameter as daily, weekly, or monthly. For example:

```
schedule:
  interval: daily
```

4. Commit your changes.

The Ansible code bot starts scanning your repository per the schedule you configured at 9 AM UTC time.
