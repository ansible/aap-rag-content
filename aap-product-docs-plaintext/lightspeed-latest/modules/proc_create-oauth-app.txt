# Creating an OAuth application

Use this procedure to create an OAuth application for your Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment.

* You have an operational Ansible automation controller instance.

1. Log in to the automation controller as an administrator.
2. Under Administration, click menu:Applications[Add].
3. Enter the following information:
1. Name: Specify a unique name for your application.
2. Organization: Select a preferred organization.
3. Authorization grant type: Select Authorization code.
4. Redirect URIs: Enter a temporary URL for now, for example, https://temp/.

The exact Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed application URL is generated after the on-premise deployment is completed. After the deployment is completed, you must change the Redirect URI to point to the generated Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed application URL. For more information, see Updating the Redirect URIs.
5. From the Client type list, select Confidential.
4. Click Save.

A pop-up window is displayed along with the generated application client ID and client secret.
5. Copy and save both the generated client ID and client secret for future use.
