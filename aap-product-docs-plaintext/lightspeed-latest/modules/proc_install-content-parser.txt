# Installing the content parser tool

Install the content parser tool, a command-line interface (CLI) tool, on your computer.

Ensure that your computer has one of the following supported OS:

* Python version 3.10 or later.
* UNIX OS, such as Linux or Mac OS.

[NOTE]
----
Installation of the content parser tool on Microsoft Windows OS is not supported.

Procedure
1. Create a working directory and set up venv Python virtual environment:

$ python -m venv ./venv

$ source ./venv/bin/activate
2. Install the latest version of the content parser tool from the pip repository:

$ pip install --upgrade pip

$ pip install --upgrade ansible-content-parser
3. Perform one of the following tasks:
* To generate a training data set without ansible-lint preprocessing, go to section Generating a custom model training data set.
* To generate a training data set with ansible-lint preprocessing, ensure that you have the latest version of ansible-lint installed on your computer:
1. View the ansible-lint versions that are installed on your computer.

$ ansible-content-parser --version

$ ansible-lint --version

A list of application versions and their dependencies are displayed.
2. In the output, verify that the version of ansible-lint that was installed with the content parser tool is the same as that of the previously-installed ansible-lint. A mismatch in the installed ansible-lint versions causes inconsistent results from the content parser tool and ansible-lint.

For example, in the following output, the content parser tool installation includes ansible-lint version 6.20.0 which is a mismatch from previously-installed ansible-lint version 6.13.1:

$ ansible-content-parser --version
ansible-content-parser 0.0.1 using ansible-lint:6.20.0 ansible-core:2.15.4
$ ansible-lint --version
ansible-lint 6.13.1 using ansible 2.15.4
A new release of ansible-lint is available: 6.13.1 â†’ 6.20.0
3. If there is a mismatch in the ansible-lint versions, deactivate and reactivate venv Python virtual environment:

$ deactivate

$ source ./venv/bin/activate
4. Verify that the version of ansible-lint that is installed with the content parser tool is the same as that of the previously-installed ansible-lint:

$ ansible-content-parser --version

$ ansible-lint --version

For example, the following output shows that both ansible-lint installations on your computer are of version 6.20.0:

$ ansible-content-parser --version
ansible-content-parser 0.0.1 using ansible-lint:6.20.0 ansible-core:2.15.4
$ ansible-lint --version
ansible-lint 6.20.0 using ansible-core:2.15.4
ansible-compat:4.1.10 ruamel-yaml:0.17.32 ruamel-yaml-clib:0.2.7
