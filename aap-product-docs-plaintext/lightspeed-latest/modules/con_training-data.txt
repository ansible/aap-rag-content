# Data gathered to train the IBM watsonx Code Assistant models

# Models

Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant uses Ansible-specific IBM watsonx Granite models unique to your organization. These models are provided, managed, and maintained by IBM.

# Data sources

IBM watsonx Code Assistant models are trained on Ansible content from Ansible Galaxy, data from public Git repositories, and Red Hat Ansible subject matter expert examples.

If you publish content to Ansible Galaxy and want to restrict your Ansible Galaxy content from being used to train the models, you can opt out of sharing your Ansible Galaxy data in the Ansible Galaxy namespace configuration.

# Data telemetry

Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed collects the following telemetry data by default:

* Operational telemetry data
* Admin dashboard telemetry data


[NOTE]

# Telemetry data collection notice for the Admin dashboard

In connection with your use of this Red Hat offering, Red Hat may collect telemetry data about your use of the software. This data allows Red Hat to monitor the software and to improve Red Hat offerings and support, including identifying, troubleshooting, and responding to issues that impact users. The data may also be used to enable you to track your entitlements to Red Hat subscriptions and take advantage of future Red Hat purchasing programs. It may also allow Red Hat to assist you in implementing upgrades to minimize service impact. The data may be shared internally within Red Hat to improve the user experience. If you are evaluating Red Hat software, the data will help Red Hat determine if you need assistance.

## What information does Red Hat collect?

Tools within the software monitor various metrics and this information is transmitted to Red Hat.  The following metrics are monitored:

* Operational telemetry data

This is the data that is required to operate and troubleshoot the Ansible Lightspeed service. For more information, refer the Enterprise Agreement. You cannot disable the collection of operational telemetry data.

This includes the following data:
* Organization you are logged into (Organization ID, account number)
* Large language model (or models) that you are connected to
* Admin dashboard telemetry data

This is the data that provides insight into how your organization users are using the Ansible Lightspeed service, and the metrics are displayed on the Admin dashboard.

This includes the following data:
* Prompts and content suggestions, including accept or reject of the content suggestions
* User sentiment feedback

You can also disable the Admin dashboard telemetry if you no longer want to collect and monitor the telemetry data. For more information about Admin dashboard telemetry, see Viewing and managing Admin dashboard telemetry.

## Personal Data

Red Hat does not intend to collect personal information. If Red Hat discovers that personal information has been inadvertently received, Red Hat will delete such information. To the extent that any telemetry data constitutes personal data, refer to the Red Hat Privacy Statement for more information about Red Hat&#8217;s privacy practices.

### Retention

Red Hat retains and stores telemetry data only for as long as it&#8217;s needed for the purposes described above or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

### Data Security

Red Hat employs technical and organizational measures designed to protect the telemetry data. Data stored in the Red Hat cloud is being protected, where possible, through encryption. Data is also segmented, and therefore is not accessible across organizations.

### Data Sharing

Red Hat may share telemetry data with its business partners in an aggregated form that does not identify customers to help the partners better understand their markets and their customer&#8217;s use of Red Hat offerings or ensure the successful integration of products jointly supported by those partners.

### Third Party Service Providers

Red Hat may engage certain service providers to assist in the collection and storage of the telemetry data.

### User Control/ Enabling and Disabling Admin Dashboard Telemetry Collection

You cannot disable collection of operational telemetry data. Operational telemetry data includes only data that is necessary to operate and troubleshoot the service. However, you can disable the collection of Admin Dashboard telemetry data. For more information, see Disabling the Admin dashboard telemetry.
