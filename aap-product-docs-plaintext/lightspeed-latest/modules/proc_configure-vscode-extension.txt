# Configuring the Ansible VS Code extension

You can configure the Ansible VS Code extension to enable Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed and specify it&#8217;s portal URL and IBM watsonx Code Assistant model ID.

* Your organization administrator has configured an IBM watsonx Code Assistant model for your organization.

1. Open the VS Code application.
2. From the Activity bar, click the Extensions icon .
3. From the Installed Extensions list, select Ansible.
4. From the Ansible extension page, click the Settings icon and select Extension Settings.
5. Select Ansible Lightspeed settings, and specify the following information:
1. Select the Enable Ansible Lightspeed checkbox.
2. In the URL for Ansible Lightspeed field, verify that you have the following URL: https://c.ai.ansible.redhat.com/.
3. Select the Enable Ansible Lightspeed with watsonx Code Assistant inline suggestions checkbox.
6. Optional: If you want to use the custom model instead of the default model, in the Model ID Override field, enter the custom model ID. The model-override setting enables you to override the default model and use the custom model, after your organization administrator has created a custom model and has shared the model ID with you separately.

Your settings are automatically saved in VS Code.

The following illustration displays the configured settings for the Ansible VS Code extension:

[NOTE]
----
If your organization recently subscribed to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, it might take a few hours for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed to detect the new subscription. In VS Code, use the Refresh button in the Ansible extension from the Activity bar to check again.
