# Merging multiple training data sets into a single file

For every execution, the content parser tool creates a training data set JSONL file named ftdata.jsonl that you upload to IBM watsonx Code Assistant for creating a custom model. If the content parser tool runs multiple times, multiple JSONL files are created. IBM watsonx Code Assistant supports a single JSONL file upload only; therefore, if you have multiple JSONL files, you must merge them into a single, concatenated file. You can also merge the multiple JSONL files that are generated in multiple subdirectories within a parent directory into a single file.

1. Using the command prompt, go to the parent directory.
2. Run the following command to create a single, concatenated file:
find . -name ftdata.json | xargs cat > concatenated.json
3. Optional: Rename the concatenated file for easy identification.

You can now upload the merged JSONL file to IBM watsonx Code Assistant and create a custom model.
