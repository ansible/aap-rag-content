# Troubleshooting Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed configuration errors

# Cannot access the Ansible Lightspeed administrator portal

The Ansible Lightspeed administrator portal can be accessed by the Red Hat organization administrator only.

If you are the Red Hat organization administrator, before you access the Ansible Lightspeed administrator portal, ensure that:

* You have a valid Ansible Automation Platform subscription.

# Cannot save the API key

When you enter the IBM watsonx Code Assistant API key, authentication fails and shows the following error message:

IBM Cloud API key is invalid

Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed verifies the API key by generating an associated access token. To resolve the error, ensure that you have not accidentally included any extra spaces when obtaining the API key from IBM watsonx Code Assistant. If you still cannot upload the API key, contact IBM Support.

# Cannot configure the model ID due to authentication failure

When you enter the model ID in the Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed administrator portal, the authentication fails.

To resolve the error, ensure that:

* You have configured a valid API key before you upload the model ID.
* You have not accidentally included any extra spaces when entering the model ID.

# Cannot configure the model ID due to inference failure

While validating the model ID, Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed performs a test inference. If Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed detects an error, the validation fails and an Inference failed message is displayed.

To resolve the error, ensure that:

* You have a valid API key and model ID.
* You have not accidentally included any extra spaces when obtaining the API key and model ID from IBM watsonx Code Assistant.
