# Managing repository scans

The Ansible code bot dashboard displays a list of your repositories where the code bot is installed, and indicates if the scan schedule is not set, or is set to manual or scheduled scan.
You can scan your Git repository by starting a manual scan, or configure a schedule to scan your repository at regular intervals. After the scan is completed, you can view the scan history (start time, status, type of scan, link to the pull request if it was created, and the log message if the scan failed). You can also add new repositories for scanning or remove existing repositories from being scanned.

# Manually scanning your Git repositories

You can manually scan your Git repositories if you did not set up a scanning schedule for your Ansible code bot or if you do not want to wait for the next scheduled scan. If you manually scan your repository, and no pull request was created, it is likely so because a duplicate pull request already exists. You can scan your repository from both the Ansible code bot dashboard and GitHub.

## Manually scanning the repository from the Ansible code bot  dashboard

1. Log in to the Ansible code bot dashboard.

The Repositories list displays a list of repositories that you selected for scanning.

[NOTE]
----
If you do not see your repository in the Repositories list, you can add it for scanning. For more information, see Adding or removing repositories from the Ansible code bot.
----
2. To start a manual scan of your repository, click the Ellipsis icon () beside the repository that you want to scan and select Scan now.
3. Click Refresh to view the status of the scan job.
4. To view more details about your repository scans, click the Ellipsis icon () beside the repository and select View scan history.

The repository&#8217;s scan history is displayed along with the scan start time, scan status, type of scan (scheduled or manual), link to the pull request if it was created, and the log message if the scan failed.
5. To view your repository on GitHub, click the Ellipsis icon () beside the repository and select View repository.

## Manually scanning the repository from GitHub

1. In GitHub, go to the main page of the repository that you want to scan.
2. To modify the repository settings, click the Settings icon beside the About area.
3. In the Topics field, enter the keyword topic ansible-code-bot-scan to the repository.

The following illustration shows the keyword topic for starting a manual scan:
![Ansible code bot settings]
4. Click Save changes.

Based on the repository webhook event, Ansible code bot starts a manual scan of your repository.
If the avoid duplicate pull requests condition is not met, then the manual scan results in a new pull request with all the necessary Ansible code bot recommendations.

# Configuring the Ansible code bot to scan your repository at regular intervals

After installing the Ansible code bot, it automatically scans the selected repositories that are in Jinja format. Once the scanning is complete, the code bot generates an initial PR for each repository; the initial PR also contains the scan schedule configured to run weekly. You must review the initial PR for the suggested changes and merge the PR. Once the initial PR is merged, the scan schedule is triggered, and the subsequent repository scans are performed weekly. If required, you can change the scan schedule to a daily or monthly cadence.


[NOTE]
----
If you do not merge the initial PR, the weekly scan schedule is not triggered and the Ansible code bot dashboard displays the repositories without any associated scan history.  In such a scenario, you must manually create a configuration file ansible-code-bot.yml and specify your scan schedule within the file.
----

You can specify one of following interval cadence to scan your Git repositories:

* Daily: Runs every day from Monday to Sunday.
* Weekly: Runs once a week on Monday. Per the initial configuration PR, the Ansible code bot is set to scan your repositories weekly until you change the schedule to daily or monthly.
* Monthly: Runs on the first day of the month, once each month.

For each interval cadence, Ansible code bot starts scanning your Git repositories at 9 AM UTC.

1. In GitHub, navigate to the repository that you want to scan.
2. Create a .yml configuration file named ansible-code-bot.yml in your repository .github folder.
For example, .github/ansible-code-bot.yml.
3. In the configuration file, specify the scan schedule in the interval parameter. You can specify the interval parameter as daily, weekly, or monthly. For example:

```
schedule:
  interval: daily
```

4. Commit your changes.

The Ansible code bot starts scanning your repository per the schedule you configured at 9 AM UTC time.

# Viewing your repository's scan history

Use the Ansible code bot dashboard to see a list of your repositories and their scan history.

# Adding or removing repositories from the Ansible code bot

You can enable the Ansible code bot for a repository, or remove repositories that you no longer want to manage.

1. Log in to the Ansible code bot dashboard.
2. Click Manage Code Bot on GitHub.
3. In GitHub, click your profile photo > Settings.
4. Under Integrations, click Applications.
5. From the Repository access area, perform one of the following tasks:
* Add a new repository: From the Select repositories list, select the repository that you want to add. The newly-added repository is displayed on the Ansible code bot dashboard.
* Remove an existing repository: From the Select repositories list, click the Cross icon beside the repository that you want to delete. The deleted repository details are no longer visible on the Ansible code bot dashboard.
6. Click Save.
