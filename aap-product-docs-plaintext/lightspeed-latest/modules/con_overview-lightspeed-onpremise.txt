# Process for configuring a Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment

Perform the following tasks to install and configure a Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment:

1. Install the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform operator
2. Create an OAuth application
3. Create connections secrets for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and IBM watsonx Code Assistant both
4. Create and deploy a Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed instance
5. Update the Redirect URI to connect to your Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment
6. Install and configure Ansible Visual Studio Code extension to connect to Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment
7. Optional: If you want to connect to a different IBM watsonx Code Assistant, update the connection secrets on an existing Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform operator
8. Optional: Monitor your Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment
