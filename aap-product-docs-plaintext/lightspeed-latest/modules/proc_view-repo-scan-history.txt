# Viewing your repository's scan history

Use the Ansible code bot dashboard to see a list of your repositories and their scan history.

1. Log in to the Ansible code bot dashboard.

The Ansible code bot dashboard displays a list of your repositories where the code bot is installed, and indicates if the scan schedule is not set, or is set to manual or scheduled scan.
2. To view the history of your repository's scans, click the Ellipsis icon () beside the repository and select View scan history.

The repository&#8217;s scan history is displayed along with the scan start time, scan status, type of scan (scheduled or manual), link to the pull request if it was created, and the log message if the scan failed.
3. To view your repository on GitHub, click the Ellipsis icon () beside the repository and select View repository.
