# Updating connection secrets on an existing Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform operator

After you have set up the Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment successfully, you can modify the deployment if you want to connect to another IBM watsonx Code Assistant model. For example, you connected to the default IBM watsonx Code Assistant model but now want to connect to a custom model instead. To connect to another IBM watsonx Code Assistant model, you must create new connection secrets, and then update the connection secrets and parameters on an existing Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform operator.

* You have set up a Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed on-premise deployment.
* You have obtained an API key and a model ID of the IBM watsonx Code Assistant model you want to connect to.
* You have created new authorization and model connection secrets for the IBM watsonx Code Assistant model that you want to connect to. For information about creating authorization and model connection secrets, see Creating connection secrets.
