# Removing seat licenses

You can remove users who no longer need to access Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed, which makes licenses available for others to use. When you remove a user, the Ansible user&#8217;s Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed seat license only is removed; it does not remove the user from your Red Hat Customer Portal organization.


[IMPORTANT]
----
To prevent deactivated RH-SSO users from accessing Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed, you must remove their Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed seat licenses. When RH-SSO users are deactivated, their Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed seat licenses are not removed automatically. These users can continue accessing Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed until the next time they are forced to reauthenticate with RH-SSO. Removing the users' seat licenses revokes their access to Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed immediately.
