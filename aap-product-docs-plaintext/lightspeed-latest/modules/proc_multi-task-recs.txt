# Requesting code recommendations for multiple tasks

You can request multitask code recommendations by entering a sequence of natural language task prompts in Ansible VS Code extension. In a YAML file, start your prompt with a pound symbol (#), and separate each prompt by using the ampersand symbol (&amp;).


```
# Install postgresql-server & run postgresql-setup command
```


For better readability, you can split your multitask inline prompts over multiple lines. To achieve this, end your current line with an ampersand symbol (&amp;) and start the next line with the hash symbol (#).


```
# Create a keypair called lightspeed-keypair & create a vpc & create vpc_id var &
# create a security group that allows SSH & create subnet with 10.0.1.0/24 cidr &
# create an internet gateway & create a route table
```


The Ansible Lightspeed service reads the text, interacts with the IBM watsonx Code Assistant model, and generates the code recommendations.

* You meet one of the following requirements:
* Your organization has a trial or paid subscription to both the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and IBM watsonx Code Assistant.
* Your organization has a trial or paid subscription to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, and you have a Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed trial account.
* You have installed and configured the Ansible VS Code extension.

1. Log in to VS Code with your Red Hat account.
2. Create a new YAML file or use an existing YAML file.
* Create a YAML file:
1. Select menu:File[New Text File].
2. From the lower right of the screen, click Plain Text, and in the language mode, select Ansible.
3. Save the file as a YAML file format extension (.yml or .yaml).
* Use an existing YAML file:
1. On the bottom right of the screen, click the existing language mode, and in the language mode settings, select Ansible.

[NOTE]
----
If you do not see the language mode section in your VS Code editor, from the Command Palette, select menu:Configure Langauge Mode[Ansible].
----
3. Verify that you see an entry for Lightspeed on the status bar at the lower right of VS Code.

If Ansible is already selected as the desired language but the Lightspeed entry is not displayed, re-select Ansible as the language mode. The following illustration shows Lightspeed entry on the VS Code status bar.
Ansible and Lightspeed set as selected language mode
![Settings show Lightspeed as selected language mode]
4. Optional: If you see an error message about missing Ansible lint, you can install the missing module or disable it. Perform any one of the following tasks:
* Install Ansible lint: For installation information, see the Installing section of the Ansible Lint documentation.
* Disable Ansible lint:
1. From the Activity bar, click the Extensions icon .
2. From the Installed extensions list, select Ansible.
3. From the Ansible extension page, click the Settings icon and select Extension Settings.
4. Clear the Ansible › Validation › Lint: Enabled checkbox.
5. Create a playbook or use an existing playbook.

For more information, see Creating playbooks in the Ansible Automation Platform Creator Guide.
6. In the playbook, provide the following information to request multitask code recommendations:
1. Start a new YAML file comment by entering a pound symbol (#) at the correct indentation.
2. Add a detailed natural language prompt in a sequence, separating each task by using the ampersand symbol (&).
Example of a multitask prompt

```
# Install postgresql-server & run postgresql-setup command
```


For better readability, split your multitask inline prompts over multiple lines. To achieve this, end your current line with an ampersand symbol (&amp;) and start the next line with the hash symbol (#).
Example of a multitask prompt split over multiple lines

```
# Create a keypair called lightspeed-keypair & create a vpc & create vpc_id var &
# create a security group that allows SSH & create subnet with 10.0.1.0/24 cidr &
# create an internet gateway & create a route table
```

3. Press Enter directly after the task description. Keep the cursor at the same location in your file, and wait for the code recommendation results to populate.

The Ansible Lightspeed service is engaged, and it starts generating code recommendations for multiple tasks.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Ansible Lightspeed service takes around 5 seconds per task to populate the code recommendations. If you are using a multitask prompt, the Ansible Lightspeed service takes a bit longer (number of tasks times 5 seconds) to populate the results. Do not move your cursor or press any key while the code recommendation is being generated. If you change the cursor location or press any key, Ansible VS Code extension cancels the request and the Ansible Lightspeed service does not process your request.
----

When the Ansible Lightspeed service is engaged, a Lightspeed processing status indicator is displayed in the lower right of the screen to denote that your code recommendation is being generated.


7. Optional: If multitask code recommendations are not being generated, log out of VS Code and log in again using your Red Hat account.
8. View your code recommendations and ensure that the recommendations match your task intent.

The following illustration shows the code recommendations generated by the Ansible Lightspeed service for the multitask prompt Install postgresql-server & run postgresql-setup command:
:


9. Accept or reject the code recommendations:
* To accept a code recommendation, press Tab.
* To reject a code recommendation, press Esc.

[NOTE]
----
If you reject a recommendation, you can modify the prompt and review the generated code recommendations once again to match your task intent.

10. On the ANSIBLE: LIGHTSPEED TRAINING MATCHES tab, view the content source matching results.

The following illustration shows the training matches found in existing Ansible Galaxy content for the task prompt multitask prompt Install postgresql-server & run postgresql-setup command:

11. Click Save to save the code recommendation changes in your Ansible YAML file.
